# x11-server — vendored from termux/termux-x11

This module is a copy of termux-x11's `lorie` library module, in the same package
(`com.termux.x11`) so it stays diffable against upstream. The native half — `libXlorie.so`, the
Xorg "Xlorie" DDX built against sixteen freedesktop submodules — is not built here: it is a
committed prebuilt under `app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/`, produced by
`.github/workflows/build_x11_native.yml` (and `../x11-local-build.sh`) from the same commit.

- upstream: <https://github.com/termux/termux-x11> (GPLv3, the licence this app already ships under)
- upstream commit: `9df8b767645aa0d0a2f2576767449df55b41962f` (2026-09-04)
- pinned in three places, which must agree: this file, `x11-server/version.gradle`, and the
  workflow's `TERMUX_X11_COMMIT`. Java from one upstream and a native library from another is a
  JNI mismatch waiting to happen.

Read this before merging a newer upstream. Everything below is a deliberate deviation; anything
not listed is upstream's code unchanged, and should be updated by taking upstream's version.

## Why the module exists at all

Termux:X11 is a second app: the `termux-x11` command starts the server as `app_process`, which
class-loads that app's APK and hands its running activity a Binder. A launcher cannot embed
another app's surface on Android 14–16, so the only way to put an X display inside the home
screen is to own the server. See `project-docs/plans/pane-wall-x11-study.md`.

## What is not vendored

| Dropped | Why |
|---|---|
| `MainActivity` | The display is a page of the pane wall, not a fullscreen single-instance activity. Replaced by `LorieHost` (below). |
| `LorieBroadcastReceiver` | The launcher declares its own receiver for the server's `ACTION_START` broadcast — not exported, behind a signature permission. |
| `LoriePreferences`' activity and `LoriePreferenceFragment` | The launcher's display settings are one screen in its own settings, written as product copy. Only the store (`PrefsProto`) and the receiver `termux-x11-preference` talks to are kept. |
| `extrakeys/*`, `utils/TermuxX11ExtraKeys`, `utils/X11ToolbarViewPager` | The launcher types into X through its own in-app keyboard and extra-keys row. A second keys bar inside the page would be a second keyboard. |
| `utils/KeyInterceptor` | An accessibility service that captures the meta key. A home screen must not install one on the user's behalf. |
| `utils/ImeHeightProvider` | Insets are the launcher's own; it has a keyboard choreographer already. |

## Deviations in the files that are vendored

- **`LorieHost.primePrefs(Context)` (new)** and `release()` keeping the `Prefs`: the launcher's
  Display page is on the wall — measured, which reads the resolution preference through
  `getPrefs()` — while the display is switched off and no host exists. Upstream's view is never
  in that position, because its activity is the host.
- **`LorieHost` (new)** stands where `MainActivity` did. It carries the exact names the view and
  input classes already use — `getPrefs()`, `prefs`, `handler`, `getInstance()`, `findActivity()`,
  `getLorieView()`, `mInputHandler`, `getRealMetrics()`, `toggleKeyboardVisibility()`,
  `handleKey()`, `setCapturingEnabled()`, `setExternalKeyboardConnected()`, `finish()`,
  `ACTION_CUSTOM`, `ACTION_STOP` — over a plain `ContextWrapper` and a `Callbacks` interface the
  launcher implements. Keeping the names is what makes a nightly merge stay a merge.
- **`LorieHost.setLorieView`** does what upstream's `MainActivity.onCreate` did after inflating
  the view: builds the `InputEventSender` and `TouchInputHandler`, hangs the touch, hover,
  generic-motion and captured-pointer listeners on the view, sets the view's `Callback` so the
  handler learns the input transform as the viewport changes, and reloads the handler's
  preferences; `handleKey` hands hardware keys to the sender. Both were missing in the first
  vendoring — the display drew but nothing on it could be touched.
- **`LorieView`**: `MainActivity` → `LorieHost`, and its `activity` field is nullable and no
  longer final. Upstream can never see a null host — its activity exists for the life of its
  process — but the launcher inflates this view as a page of the pane wall, which can happen
  before a host exists and can outlive one, and a null dereference here is the home screen
  falling over. `LorieHost.setLorieView` hands the host back to the view so construction order
  does not matter. The one behavioural cut is the composing-text path's call into upstream's
  additional-keys bar, which is not vendored.
- **`input/TouchInputHandler`, `input/InputEventSender`**: `MainActivity` → `LorieHost`. Three
  gesture/notification actions lose their target — "toggle additional key bar" and "open
  preferences" become no-ops, and the notification's "restart activity" is gone — because they
  were upstream's own chrome.
- **`utils/SamsungDexUtils.dexMetaKeyCapture`** takes a `Context` instead of an `Activity` and
  resolves the component name itself; there is no activity behind the page.
- **`LoriePreferences`** is a plain container for `PrefsProto` and `Receiver`. Its
  `ACTION_PREFERENCES_CHANGED` constant is kept and made public, and the string the command-line
  `main` broadcasts is the new public `ACTION_CHANGE_PREFERENCE`: the launcher's manifest
  declares the vendored `Receiver` for it (not exported, signature permission — the same guard as
  the server's announcement), and `X11DisplayHostController` listens for the changed broadcast to
  re-read the store into the live view, which is what upstream's `MainActivity` did. The
  `enableAccessibilityServiceAutomatically` and `extra_keys_config` branches of the receiver's
  setter are gone with the features they set. `PrefsProto.IntPreference` gains the `put(int)` its
  boolean and string siblings already have, for the launcher's settings page.
- **`res/xml/preferences.xml`** loses upstream's "main" screen — the rows that navigated into the
  four sections and the version row — because those titles only existed for the dropped activity,
  and AAPT links a resource file whether or not anything shows it. The store's schema, which is
  what `:x11-server:generatePrefs` reads, is untouched.
- **`build.gradle`** is ours: our compileSdk/minSdk/Java 11, `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID` from
  the edition's applicationId (the server broadcasts to and class-loads *our* APK), and the
  `generatePrefs` task carried over so the store and its schema can never disagree.
- **`ci/x11-patch/0001-look-up-the-host-class-as-LorieHost.patch`** is the one native change.
  The JNI surface names the host class and the `LorieView` field that holds it — the server does
  `FindClassOrDie("com/termux/x11/MainActivity")` and reads `activity` as that type — and nothing
  type-checks either, so the abort is at runtime, on the first `LorieView`. Two string literals
  become `LorieHost`; `clientConnectedStateChanged()` and the view's `resetIme()` keep their names
  and signatures. The rest of the JNI surface (`LorieView`, `CmdEntryPoint`) is untouched.
- **`ci/x11-patch/0002-forward-the-cursor-name-to-the-host.patch`** adds the second native change:
  an `EVENT_CURSOR_NAME_CHANGED` event that carries the name of the cursor the X pointer is
  showing (`CursorRec.name`, resolved with `ValidAtom`/`NameForAtom` in `lorieSetCursor`, sent only
  when it changed, and repeated when a host attaches). It is how the Display page can tell that a
  tap landed on a text field: X tells the host nothing about focus, and XFixes publishes the name
  only to X clients, which the host is not. The patch applies **after 0001** — it extends the same
  `nativeInit` block — and pairs with `LorieView.onCursorNameChanged` below; `FindMethodOrDie`
  kills the process if the Java method and the prebuilt ever disagree.
- **`LorieView.setClipboardSyncActive(boolean)` (new)**, and with it the `clipboardSyncActive`
  flag, the reduced `onWindowFocusChanged` and the relaxed test in `checkForClipboardChange`:
  the Android → X announce is armed by the page, not by window focus. Upstream registers its
  `OnPrimaryClipChangedListener` in `onWindowFocusChanged`, which the pane wall never fires — the
  Display page is attached with `requestFocus()` inside a window whose focus does not change — so
  text copied in Android was announced to X only by accident. `X11DisplayHostController` arms the
  view while it is attached, connected and `clipboardEnable` is on (`DisplayClipboardPolicy`);
  arming runs one `checkForClipboardChange()`, and the setter is idempotent so the listener can
  never be registered twice. `onWindowFocusChanged` keeps only the re-check, so a focus loss
  cannot silently disarm a page that says it is active, and `onDetachedFromWindow` disarms,
  because the page can go without anyone saying so. `checkForClipboardChange` no longer demands
  `getMimeTypeCount() == 1`: a browser copy carries text/plain *and* text/html, and upstream
  drops it. Both it and `requestClipboard` return early when `connected()` is false, and
  `connected()` itself now checks the pointer — a wall page is asked after it has left its
  window, where upstream's view is already gone with its activity.
- **`LorieView.onCursorNameChanged(String)` (new)** is the Java end of that event: it keeps the
  last name (`getCursorName()`) and forwards it to an optional `CursorNameListener`. Upstream has
  no such method, so a nightly merge must carry it forward with the native patch.
- **`stub/`** is upstream's `shell-loader/stub` — compile-only declarations of the hidden
  framework classes `CmdEntryPoint` reaches for while it runs outside an app process.
- Only `res/values/arrays.xml` and `res/xml/preferences.xml` are vendored from upstream's
  resources; its strings, styles, layouts, icons and the accessibility-service config belong to
  the app it was.

## `loader/`

Upstream's `shell-loader`, vendored the same way: the few kilobytes of dex that
`$PREFIX/bin/termux-x11` puts on `app_process`'s CLASSPATH, which finds the launcher's APK,
checks its signature against a hash baked in at build time, class-loads its dex and calls
`CmdEntryPoint.main`. It is never installed. Deviations: our compileSdk/minSdk/targetSdk (the
shared-user SELinux rule in AGENTS.md applies to it too), the package and signature it trusts are
the edition's own, and its error strings say what a launcher user would need to hear. The
`termux-x11-nightly` apt package cannot serve here at all — it bakes `com.termux.x11` into both
the script and the signature check.

Upstream's "is it installed" and "does the signature match" checks are Java `assert` statements.
ART runs `app_process` without `-ea`, so they never executed and any APK with the right
applicationId was class-loaded. Ours are explicit checks that print upstream's error text and exit
non-zero (`Loader.java`); the `AssertionError` catch went with them.

`app/build.gradle` packs the built APK into the launcher's assets as `assets/x11/loader.apk`, and
`X11CliInstaller` writes it and the two scripts into the prefix.

## Merging a newer upstream

1. `git -C <termux-x11 checkout> diff <pinned>..<new> -- lorie/src/main/java lorie/src/main/res/xml lorie/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml lorie/src/main/aidl`
2. Apply what touches the vendored files, re-doing the renames above (`MainActivity` →
   `LorieHost` is the only mechanical one).
3. Bump the commit in this file *and* `version.gradle` *and* the workflow, dispatch
   `build_x11_native.yml`, and commit the new `libXlorie.so` prebuilts from the same run.
4. `./gradlew :x11-server:assembleDebug :app:assembleDebug` and check the Display page on a
   device — the JNI surface between `CmdEntryPoint`/`LorieView` and the native library is not
   type-checked by anything.

## Two things that only fail at runtime

Both were found by running it, not by reading it, and both are cheap to break again:

- **The loader must be read-only in the prefix.** ART refuses a writable dex file on `CLASSPATH`
  ("Writable dex file ... is not allowed") and aborts `app_process` before `Loader.main`, so
  `X11CliInstaller` clears the write bit after copying it out.
- **The server needs the XKB data or it exits before opening a port.** It comes from the
  `xkeyboard-config` package, and upstream only knows how to find it under `com.termux`'s own
  prefix, so the generated `termux-x11` points `XKB_CONFIG_ROOT` at this edition's. The Display
  page says what to install when it is missing.

## Touchscreen mode is the launcher's tablet mode

Upstream has three touch modes and the middle one, `touchMode` 2 ("Simulated touch"), is mouse
emulation: one finger moves the pointer, a drag needs a long press first, and two fingers are the
wheel. On a phone that is the wrong half of a tablet. The launcher's Touchscreen mode delivers the
same real XI2 touches Direct touch (`touchMode` 3) does, and keeps the launcher's own behaviour
around them — the keyboard that follows text fields reads its taps, and the picture's pinch-zoom
stays off so the two fingers belong to the X client.

- **`input/InputStrategyInterface.TabletTouchInputStrategy` (new)** is a `NullInputStrategy`
  subclass with nothing added. `TouchInputHandler` already recognises `NullInputStrategy` as "the
  handler sends the raw events itself", so every branch that moves a cursor, sends a mouse click
  or offers the gesture to the zoom detector leaves mode 2 alone exactly as it leaves mode 3, and
  no `instanceof` in that file had to change. The separate type is what keeps the two modes
  distinguishable — in the log line below, and for anything the launcher later adds on top of
  touch without adding it to Direct touch as well.
- **`input/TouchInputHandler.setInputMode`** builds that strategy for `InputMode.SIMULATED_TOUCH`.
  `InputMode` itself, the preference and its stored values are untouched: the mode a user picks is
  still 2. `SimulatedTouchInputStrategy` is kept in `InputStrategyInterface`, unused, so the file
  stays diffable against upstream.
- **`input/TouchInputHandler.handleTouchEvent`** logs one line per `ACTION_DOWN` under the tag
  `X11TouchMode` — the event's source, its tool type and the strategy about to read it. It is a
  diagnostic for a reported landscape bug where the display behaves as if it were in Trackpad
  mode, and can go once that is understood.

The app side of the same feature is not in this module: Firefox is given `MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1` by
`X11LinuxAppRunner`, and Android's Back is answered by the launcher (`DisplayBackPolicy`) before
`LorieHost.handleKey` ever sees it — the page's `consumeLauncherKey` takes `KEYCODE_BACK`, lowers
a keyboard the place raised, and otherwise sends Linux `KEY_BACK` (evdev 158, `XF86Back`) as a
scancode through `LorieView.sendKeyEvent`.

## The server names core glyph cursors (2026-09-11)

`ci/x11-patch/0003-name-core-glyph-cursors.patch` is the third native change, and it exists
because 0002 was not enough on a real phone. The cursor name 0002 forwards is only ever set by
libXcursor, on cursors it loads from a theme; a Termux prefix with no `share/icons/*/cursors`
leaves GTK, Qt and Firefox on the core font cursors of `XCreateFontCursor`, which carry no name at
all, so every tap on the Display page reported "(no name)" and the keyboard never followed a text
field.

- **What it names.** Glyph N of the core "cursor" font is the shape `XC_<name> == N` of
  `X11/cursorfont.h` — the list libXcursor's theme names come from — so the server sets
  `CursorRec.name` to that name: `left_ptr`, `xterm`, `hand2`, byte for byte what a themed client
  would have set. Only even glyphs below `XC_num_glyphs` (the odd ones are those shapes' masks),
  only when the source font's `FONT` property is the literal "cursor" (the one core font with no
  XLFD name — the cheap test that the glyphs really are the standard shapes), and never over a
  cursor that already has a valid name, so `XFixesSetCursorName` still wins.
- **Where the hook is.** In lorie's own `InitOutput.c`, wrapping `ProcVector[X_CreateGlyphCursor]`
  from `InitOutput` and naming the cursor after upstream's handler created it. Naming it in dix's
  `AllocGlyphCursor` would be three lines, and a hunk there does apply — but `xserver` is one of
  the sixteen pinned freedesktop submodules, which termux-x11's own CMake patches at configure
  time (`patches/xserver.patch`, `patch -N`), so our edit would live in a tree that is re-fetched
  on every submodule bump and tracked by nothing here. Byte-swapped clients reach the same entry,
  and `ProcVector` is not rebuilt per server generation, hence the wrapper's idempotence check.
- **No Java change.** The names ride the 0002 event, so `LorieView.onCursorNameChanged` and the
  host's `CursorNameListener` are untouched; nothing new is resolved with `FindMethodOrDie`.
- **Merging.** 0003 applies after 0002 and edits the same file, below the block 0002 adds. Carry
  the two forward together, and rebuild the prebuilts from the same commit as always.
