/**
 * What upstream's {@code MainActivity} was to the display view, minus the activity.
 *
 * <p>Termux:X11 owns a fullscreen, single-instance activity and the view reaches back into it for
 * preferences, a main-thread handler, the input handler and a handful of chrome toggles. The
 * launcher has no such activity — the display is a page of the pane wall — so this is the seam
 * that stands in its place: the same names the vendored view and input classes already use, over
 * a plain Context and a {@link Callbacks} the launcher implements.
 *
 * <p>Keeping the names is deliberate. It is what makes the vendored files diffable against
 * upstream (see {@code x11-server/UPSTREAM.md}), so a nightly merge stays a merge.
