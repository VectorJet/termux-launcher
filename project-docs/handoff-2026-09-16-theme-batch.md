# Handoff — Material theme batch (2026-09-16, overnight run)

Everything landed on branch **`integ/theme-keys-layout`** in worktree `../termux-launcher-integ`
(15 commits over dev `67454594`). `dev` is untouched because the main checkout held a peer
session's uncommitted help/keyboard edits. Nothing pushed.

To land it: `git merge --no-ff integ/theme-keys-layout` on `dev` once the peer's edits are
committed or stashed (they touch `strings.xml`, `TermuxActivity.java`, `TermuxInAppKeyboard.java`,
`Keyboard2View.java`; the integ branch touches the first three too, expect a small merge in each).
Feature worktrees `../wt-trim-copy`, `../wt-keyboard-theme`, `../wt-extra-keys`,
`../wt-theme-pipeline`, `../wt-material-palette` are merged and can be removed.

## What landed

| Branch | What | Where to read |
|---|---|---|
| feat/trim-copy | Terminal › Clipboard "Trim trailing spaces on wrapped lines" (default on). A wrapped row trims like an unwrapped one; keeps one space when the next row starts mid-word. Fixed-width internal paths untouched. | `TerminalBuffer.getSelectedText`, `TerminalEmulator.setTrimWrappedTrailingSpaces` |
| feat/keyboard-theme | Default keyboard theme as Material 3: tray surfaceContainer(Low), letters surfaceContainerHighest/Lowest, function keys surfaceContainerHigh + onSurfaceVariant, Enter primary/onPrimary, latched primaryContainer, no borders, 10 dp radius. New `Theme.Palette.functionKeyBackground/functionLabelColor`, `Keyboard2View.isEnterKey`. Imported Base16 schemes derive a function tier. | `InAppKeyboardPaletteFactory`, `inapp-keyboard/UPSTREAM.md` |
| feat/extra-keys | `ExtraKeyEligibility` (5 bands, all 90 tools classified, reflection gate test); `ExtraKeyColorRole` (11 tokens, resolved from theme attrs on bind); `color` in the key JSON; place switches default to primary/secondary/tertiary containers on fresh installs; pick mode in the Appearance editor (staged via `ExtraKeyColorStaging`, commits on Done) and a Colour row in `ExtraKeyDetailSheet`. | `ExtraKeyEligibility` javadoc table, `docs/en/Launcher_Settings.md` |
| feat/theme-pipeline | Audit: uiMode flip and Material You recreate already re-apply colours, keyboard and templates; the wallpaper listener covers the foreground. New: `TermuxApplication.onConfigurationChanged` re-exports the palette and re-runs templates on a night-mask change while the launcher is stopped. New built-in template `herdr` (splices `[theme.custom]` into config.toml in a marker block, restores commented keys on undo). Signature test for the day/night flip. | `TermuxApplication`, `assets/theme-templates/herdr/`, `scripts/theme-templates/check.sh` |
| feat/material-palette | ANSI slots from HCT: canonical hues harmonized ≤15° toward primary, primary's chroma clamped [28, 52], tones 80/90 dark and 40/30 light, neutrals from the surface hue. Slots 0 and 7 exempt from the contrast floor, slot 8 at 3:1. oh-my-posh theme as container pills; starship palette gains every Material role name plus a commented Material prompt block. | `MaterialTerminalColorScheme.ansiSlots`, `MaterialTerminalColorSchemeTest` |
| docs | `project-docs/layout-freedom/SPEC.md` (scope A decided), entries in `release-notes-v0.2.40.md` | |

## Verification

- Full `testDebugUnitTest` on the merged tree: 4,271 app tests, one failure —
  `TerminalIOPreferencesDataStoreLazyModeTest`, the order-dependent flake AGENTS.md names; it passes
  alone. terminal-emulator, termux-shared and inapp-keyboard suites green.
  `scripts/theme-templates/check.sh`: all ten PASS.
- Waydroid (x86_64 debug APK, dark mode, teal wallpaper):
  - Extra keys greying on the Home place verified: mouse-mode and add-pane keys dimmed; place
    switches, keyboard and session browser usable. Coloured place-switch keys were not visible
    because the container carries an old saved layout (no migration by design).
  - Keyboard: at first every chip drew in the same translucent grey. Root cause: the shipped
    layout `termux_launcher_qwerty.xml` defines its own bottom row without `role` attributes, so
    ctrl/alt/space/enter parsed as `Role.Normal` and never reached the action/function/space
    paints. Fixed in `517d6307`: `Keyboard2View.tierFor` classifies role-less keys from their
    value and the layout carries the roles. **Verified on pong 2026-09-16 07:15**: Enter in the
    accent colour, function keys one tone below the letters.
  - Not looked at: light mode, the colour popup, the starship/oh-my-posh pills, herdr.

## Layout freedom (same day, after the theme batch)

L1–L4 merged into dev by `e3f1f514` (model `781d6bbc`, miniature `8d44dfd5`, hosts `4985dd32`,
rail + TOP rows `e3f1f514`); outcomes and the two model decisions (A–Z rides the apps row only
when it lies down; side status bar stacks beside the rail instead of sharing a column) are in
`project-docs/layout-freedom/SPEC.md`. Full unit suite green on dev.

Pong gate 2026-09-16 08:40: the default layout renders byte-identical to before; the Layout
editor lifts a band after a hold, shows the insertion gap on the hovered edge and the hide tray;
dropping the extra keys on TOP reorders the miniature and the real screen renders the row under
the status bar with the terminal moved down; dragging it back restores the original layout. Not
checked on device: landscape rail positions, a side status bar beside the rail, an apps row on
TOP, extra keys on a side edge, the narrow-canvas notice, Discard/↺ after a re-order. Known
visual gap: a bar off the dock (TOP row) draws straight over the wallpaper with no glass sheet.

### Defect fixes after the first pong round (same day)

Four defects the developer found (rail icons piled and hidden after reload; bottom order never
rendered; A–Z dragged along to TOP with a seam and no radius; dock glass short after a move) →
P1 `9caaf19b`, P2 `6e4f9eb4`, P3 `b673929a`, all on dev; suite green (4,422 app tests). Decision
taken by the developer: the A–Z index rides the apps row only when both sit on the same edge.
Design consequence recorded in the SPEC P3 outcome: a BOTTOM status bar always stands above the
dock stack whatever order it is given. Installed on pong 10:35, **not yet checked on the phone**:
the P1/P2/P3 phone lists live in the SPEC's "Defects found on pong" and outcome sections.

### Second pong round (11:00–11:40)

- Rail: one more fix (`b76e2355`, the vertical render gate measured its own stale height); then
  verified — icons in a column, scrolls, survives the reload-style broadcast.
- Bottom order (P3) verified with the developer's stored non-default order.
- Extra-key colours: the fill never rendered (MaterialButton re-applies its transparent style tint
  over a custom background); fixed `0637698c`, defaults now `primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary`;
  verified as filled pills.
- P4 `0b7a3364` (developer decision): side stacks flank the canvas only — keyboard, dock rows and
  status bar stay full width (verified); a side rail opens the drawer with a horizontal swipe toward
  the centre, plane grows out of the rail. **Not verified**: adb swipes did not open the drawer
  (adb gestures also stopped lifting editor bands after the first tries, so this is not evidence of
  a bug) — needs a finger. Minor artifact seen: a clipped rail icon peeks below the rail beside
  the dock's top edge; clip the canvas band.
- Still unchecked on device: dock glass width after returning the row to the bottom (P1 part 2),
  the top plank and the ride rule (P2), the narrow-canvas notice, landscape.

### Third pong round (12:15–12:45)

Developer found: apps row on TOP filled the whole terminal with the plank and one giant icon; a
side column could not be lifted in the miniature by finger. P5 `0990b194`: the plank's glass was
`match_parent` inside a wrap host (measured the whole column), the apps bar's row-height hint was
0 off the dock so the icon fell back to the host height (now a band hint, capped at two rail
slots), the miniature claimed side columns before the bottom rows and drew a 6 dp grip (now
TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT and a grip hit rect as wide as the band). Verified on pong 12:41: TOP
apps row is one row deep with normal icons, terminal below, A–Z stays at the bottom. Drawer swipe
from a side rail and its animation confirmed by the developer by finger.

### Fourth pong round (12:55–13:30)

Developer found: TOP row pages but no indicator; side rail no paging and running past the
terminal frame (clipped icon); side A–Z bunched in the top third with a 454 px capsule. P6
`f2484201`: `DockPagingModel.railItemsPerPage` + vertical page swipe in the arbiter (drawer pull
stays horizontal), a `PageTickStripView` that travels with the row's host on every edge, side
stacks inset by `terminalFrameInsetPx`, A–Z column length = the canvas band (it had subtracted
top/bottom chrome that no longer flank it). Installed 13:25, phone was locked — **not checked**.
Checklist: LEFT rail level with the frame, swipe up/down pages, dot strip between rail and
terminal, sideways drag still opens the drawer; TOP row shows dots under it; RIGHT A–Z capsule
spans the canvas with letters spread; BOTTOM arrangement unchanged.

### Fifth pong round (13:31–14:10)

Developer found: two page indicators with a side rail (the dock FX view's ticks still drawn at
the bottom with the accent, P6's strip beside the rail without it) and the A–Z scrub preview on a
side bar rising over the letters. P7 `7410be92`, designed as ownership not patches: one
`PageTickStripView` per apps-row host on every edge, fed by `SuggestionBarView.publishPageIndicator`
(the FX view's tick drawing, its animators and the dead ambient glow deleted;
`apps_bar_indicator_band` is the strip's band, so the dock is ~6 dp taller); `AzFloatingStripPolicy`
owns the edge and lays the preview out as a row of icons growing toward the screen centre,
clamped to the canvas. Installed 14:05 while the developer was in another app — **not checked**.
Checklist: exactly one strip on each edge with the accent on the current page; dock height reads
right (else move the band into the row's top padding); RIGHT column hold → matches run left of the
finger, name above the focused icon; LEFT/TOP mirrored; BOTTOM unchanged.

### Afternoon rounds (14:20–15:45)

- P8 `4266ff35`: a lone apps row gets ~4 dp air (default dock byte-identical); separators only
  between adjacent bands in one stack (`EdgeStackPolicy.separatorsFor`), `extrakeys_divider` gone.
  Judgement calls for the developer: the lone row's air sits inside the glass; the default dock
  now shows a seam between the apps row and the letters.
- Corner hold `6a09dbe8`: `CornerHoldArbiter` — the widget frame never cancelled the grid's 400 ms
  long press once the 300 ms corner hold claimed, so both fired on Home.
- P9 `6ce2afa0`: a BOTTOM status bar is a band of `accessory_row_stack` and honours its order;
  own glass only when it touches the canvas; `place_edge_stack_bottom` deleted.
- Row mute `df93a6cd`: the apps row went blank after a page swipe and the A–Z scrub stopped
  filtering — a latched draw suppression with no release path; now never latched on a rendered
  row, the release chain always re-posts, the dock hint is waived when overdue, one
  `finishSwipeSettle`.
- P10: status stats/weather cards and the expanded bar grow toward the centre per edge
  (`StatusBarLensPolicy`), the bar's own row stays at its edge when expanded (TOP unchanged);
  `NotificationSwipePolicy`: quick reply = toward-centre swipe from a badged icon, 24 dp flick
  commits, past 45 % of the drawer travel it hands off to the drawer pull; BOTTOM unchanged.
  Judgement call to relay: on TOP the row already sits at the panel's bottom with the clock above,
  so "row stays at the edge" was applied as "row is the lower band on both row edges" — TOP is
  byte-identical; pinning the TOP row to the screen edge would be a visible change, not done.
All device checks for these are the developer's (phone in use); nothing here is device-verified.

## Decisions taken without the developer (change freely)

- Trim rule keeps one space when a wrapped row ended in spaces and the next row starts mid-word.
- Extra keys colour tokens: primary/secondary/tertiary/error, their containers, surface_variant,
  black, white. DRAWER usable on Home; session browser/panel greyed on Display; `window.next/prev`
  stay usable on Display (they step apps there).
- Keyboard luminance targets for the forced light/dark variants are reasoned from M3 tones.

## Follow-ups

1. Pick mode has no affordance beyond tapping a key while the keyboard card is up; consider a
   hint row on the keyboard card. Pick mode drives extra-keys page 0 only.
2. Layout freedom L1–L5 per `project-docs/layout-freedom/SPEC.md` — scope A, portrait side
   columns allowed, start after this batch is merged.
3. The starship Material prompt ships commented out (apply.sh rewrites the marker block on every
   refresh). For a live version add an opt-in in `template.properties` or a second template id.
4. Remove the five `wt-*` worktrees.

## herdr copy mode exits mid-selection — herdr bug, report upstream

herdr v0.9.0 (`github.com/herdrdev/herdr`, tag v0.9.0). Two mechanisms, both worsened by another
pane redrawing (the braille spinner):

1. `src/client/shell/copy_mode.rs:518-522` — `move_copy_cursor` (every arrow/hjkl) calls
   `exit_copy_mode(false, …)` when `copy_hit()` finds no hit-test entry for the copy-mode pane.
   `src/client/shell/surface_patch.rs:77-78` forces every incoming surface patch onto the slow path
   while `copy_mode.is_some()`, and the slow path (`state.rs:1533-1581`, `self.hits =
   ShellHitMap::default()` at 1552/1580) wipes the hit map for all panes until the matching
   snapshot pair arrives. An arrow key in that window exits copy mode silently.
2. `src/raw_input.rs:22, 361-378` — `RAW_INPUT_IDLE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS = 10`; a lone `0x1b` still
   in the buffer after 10 ms is flushed as a bare Escape, which clears the selection or exits copy
   mode. The launcher writes `ESC [ D` in one write, so this only bites when herdr's loop is busy.

Suggested fix: don't clear `hits` for panes unrelated to the incoming patch (or drop the motion
instead of exiting on a missing hit), and lengthen the lone-ESC idle flush. Launcher side: nothing
to change (`TerminalSession.write` queues the whole sequence; `TerminalKeyEventHandler
.dispatchSlider` sends plain DPAD events, the same path as tapped arrows).
