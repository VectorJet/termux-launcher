# tlstore — the launcher's tool store

`tlstore` (aliases `tl`, `tls`) is a small package-manager-style CLI shipped inside the launcher
APK. It installs, lists, updates and removes the tools and configs the launcher shows off but does
not ship: the showcase binaries from `PickleHik3/termux-launcher-binaries`, the opinionated shell
configs from `docs/en/examples`, apt/pacman packages, and Claude Code. It replaces the interactive
`setup-launcher` script (which stays, but points here).

Written 2026-09-06. Decisions here are settled; raise, do not silently change.

## Shape

- One POSIX `sh` program, `app/src/main/assets/tlstore/tlstore`, no bash-isms (Termux `sh` is dash).
  Runtime needs only the bootstrap: `curl`, `tar`, `sha256sum`, `sha512sum`, `base64`, `od`, `sed`,
  `awk`. Optional: `fzf` (picker), `patchelf` (npm-musl), `minisign` (catalog refresh).
- The app writes it on every start (`TlstoreInstaller`, modelled on `app/x11/X11CliInstaller`):
  `$PREFIX/bin/tlstore`, symlinks `$PREFIX/bin/tl` and `$PREFIX/bin/tls`,
  `$PREFIX/libexec/termux-launcher/tlstore/{catalog.tsv,trusted.pub,.installed}`. Marker comment
  `# written by termux-launcher` in the script's first lines; a foreign `tlstore`/`tl`/`tls` is left
  alone and reported, never overwritten.
- User state: `~/.local/share/tlstore/installed.tsv` (what tlstore installed, with files),
  `~/.local/share/tlstore/catalog.tsv` (verified refreshed catalog, optional),
  `~/.cache/tlstore/` (downloads). Payloads go to `~/.local/bin/<name>` and `~/.local/lib/<name>/`,
  never `$PREFIX/bin` (a bootstrap reinstall wipes it; apt owns names there). Replaced user files
  get a timestamped `.bak` beside them, as setup-launcher does today.
- Edition/prefix is read from `$PREFIX` (`/data/data/<app package>/files/usr`); env override
  `TLSTORE_PREFIX` for tests on a Linux host.

## Catalog

Tab-separated, UTF-8, `#` comment lines, one header comment carrying the serial:

```
# tlstore catalog	serial=2026090601
# name	kind	version	prefixes	source	digest	target	requires	options	summary
```

Columns:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`, unique per prefix set |
| `kind` | `pkg` \| `binary` \| `file` \| `file-once` \| `script` \| `npm-musl` \| `bundle` |
| `version` | `-` for pkg/bundle; upstream version for binary/file/script; `latest` or pinned for npm-musl |
| `prefixes` | `*` or comma list of app packages (`com.termux`, `io.vaj.tl`, `com.termux.launcher.nix`) |
| `source` | `pkg`: space-separated package names. `binary`/`file`/`file-once`/`script`: a URL, or `binaries:<asset>@<tag>` (→ `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher-binaries/<tag>/bin/<asset>`) or `launcher:<path>@<tag>` (→ `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher/<tag>/<path>`). `npm-musl`: `npm:<package>#<executable inside package/>`. `bundle`: `-` |
| `digest` | sha256 hex of the downloaded file; `-` for pkg, bundle, npm-musl (npm's registry sha512 is the check) |
| `target` | install path with `~`; `-` = default (`~/.local/bin/<name>` for binary, `~/.local/lib/<name>` for npm-musl, none for others) |
| `requires` | comma list of catalog names installed first; bundle members live here |
| `options` | `;`-separated `key=value`: `env=K=V` (wrapper exports, repeatable with `,`), `tz=1` (wrapper exports TZ from `persist.sys.timezone`), `mode=755`, `post=<catalog script name>` |
| `summary` | one plain sentence, product copy |

Rules: one row per (name, prefix set) — per-edition builds are separate rows with their own
digest (fastfetch, musl-loader). tlstore uses the first row whose `prefixes` matches. Items whose
kind needs aarch64 (`binary`, `npm-musl`) are hidden on other CPUs.

Generated, never hand-edited: `scripts/tlstore/build-catalog.sh` reads `docs/en/examples/*`
(digests), the checked-out `termux-launcher-binaries` `SHA256SUMS` (path argument), the item
definitions in `scripts/tlstore/items.tsv` (hand-maintained: everything but digests), and writes
`app/src/main/assets/tlstore/catalog.tsv` with `serial=YYYYMMDDNN`.

Initial items: `fish`, `oh-my-posh`, `zoxide`, `eza`, `neovim`, `build-tools` (pkg); `config-fish`
(file), `personal-fish` (file-once), `omp-theme` (file), `setup-nvim` (script); `sigye`, `kitten`,
`fastfetch` ×2 rows, `musl-loader` ×2 rows (binary); `claude-code` (npm-musl, requires
`musl-loader,patchelf`; options `env=DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1;tz=1`); `patchelf` (pkg); bundles
`shell-setup` (fish, oh-my-posh, zoxide, eza, config-fish, omp-theme, personal-fish), `dev-tools`
(build-tools, neovim, setup-nvim), `showcase` (sigye, fastfetch, kitten).

### Trust

- Baseline catalog = the one in the APK. Payload digests come from it; `pkg` goes through apt/pacman;
  `npm-musl` verifies the registry's `dist.integrity` sha512 over TLS.
- Refresh: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher/main/app/src/main/assets/tlstore/catalog.tsv`
  and `catalog.tsv.minisig`, verified with `minisign -V -p $PREFIX/libexec/termux-launcher/tlstore/trusted.pub`.
  Accepted only when its serial is newer than the active one. No `minisign` → offer `pkg install
  minisign`; still none → refresh is off and the baseline is used, said in one line.
  `TLSTORE_CATALOG_URL` overrides the URL (tests use `file://`).
- The signing key lives with the maintainer (`~/.config/vaj-apt/tlstore-minisign.key`), never in
  a repo or an agent worktree. `scripts/tlstore/sign.sh` signs; the orchestrator runs it.

## Commands

```
tlstore                       help
tlstore list [-i|-a]          everything (installed marked), or installed only / available only
tlstore search <term>         name and summary match
tlstore info <name>           version, kind, source, digest, requires, files, summary
tlstore install [name...] [-y]   no names → multi-select picker (fzf --multi, else numbered toggles)
tlstore remove <name...> [-y]
tlstore update [name...] [--check] [--offline]   refresh catalog, then upgrade what is newer
tlstore refresh               catalog only
tlstore shell                 = install shell-setup
tlstore doctor                prefix, PATH order, tools present, catalog serial, drift, loader check
tlstore version
```

Exit codes 0/1/2 (ok / failed / usage). `TLSTORE_ASSUME_YES=1` = `-y` everywhere. Output is plain
text, one line per action, product copy (no mechanism talk); errors start with `tlstore: `.
`update` for `pkg` items runs the package manager's own upgrade for exactly those names
(`apt install --only-upgrade` / `pacman -S --needed`).

## As built (2026-09-06)

Deviations from the text above, all deliberate: an `args=` option passes arguments to a `script`
item (`setup-nvim`); a `fastfetch-libs` pkg item carries fastfetch's runtime libraries and both
fastfetch rows require it; the `npm-musl` wrapper is named after the executable in the source
(`claude`), its directory after the item; `musl-loader` targets `~/.local/lib/musl/` and the
npm-musl install copies it from there; `claude-code` is limited to the editions with a loader;
`update --check` does not guess about `latest`-pinned items; a refused refresh exits 1;
`remove` on a pkg item only stops tracking it; a bundle member with no row on this device is
skipped with a line; the picker lists only what is not installed; the CLI reads two test knobs,
`TLSTORE_ARCH` and `TLSTORE_PATCHELF`. The app installer stamps the marker with the app's
versionName as well, so every release rewrites the files.

Verified 2026-09-06 on the x86_64 emulator (debug build): the app writes `tlstore`, `tl`, `tls`,
the catalog and key; list, info, doctor, a real apt install, update, a failed refresh, the picker
and remove behave. Not yet run on a device: binary, npm-musl and refresh against the published
catalog (the binaries tag `2026.09.06` and the catalog on `main` are not pushed yet).

Side queue: publish `minisign` in the VAJ apt repo (needs the build VM).

## Revision 2 (2026-09-06)

The developer tried the store and asked for a much smaller catalog and stricter handling of config
files. What follows supersedes the item list and the `script` kind above.

### Seven visible items

`list`, `search` and the picker show exactly `claude-code`, `fastfetch`, `fish-shell`, `kitten`,
`nvim-theme`, `omp-theme`, `sigye`, alphabetically. Everything else carries `hidden=1` in `options`:
it is a part another item pulls in through `requires`, never listed, never searched, never offered
in the picker, and `install <hidden name>` is refused with "that is part of another item". `info` on
a hidden name still works, because names appear in `Needs` lines.

Gone: `neovim`, `build-tools`, `dev-tools`, `shell-setup`, `showcase`, `setup-nvim`, and the
standalone `patchelf` pkg item. `config-fish` and `personal-fish` became hidden parts of
`fish-shell`. `tlstore shell` now means `install fish-shell`.

`list` drops the `installed`/`-` column for a leading `*`, and prints
`needs while installing: <tools>` indented under an item that declares `build=`.

### New kinds and options

| addition | meaning |
|---|---|
| `hidden=1` | a part, not a choice (above) |
| `build=<pkgs>` | packages needed only while installing |
| kind `fisher` | `source` is a space-separated plugin list; install runs `fish -c 'fisher install …'`, remove the matching `fisher remove`, version `-`, and `update` leaves it alone — fisher updates are the user's (`fisher update`) |

Removed with them: kind `script` and its `args=` and `post=` options, which only `setup-nvim` used.
The dependency sort now reasons about `requires` alone.

### Config files are never replaced silently

For a `file` item (not `file-once`, not a binary) whose destination exists and differs, tlstore
downloads the new file to the cache, prints the item name, shows `diff -u` (a before/after of the
first 25 lines each where `diff` is missing) and asks `Replace your <basename>? [y/N]`. **`-y` and
`TLSTORE_ASSUME_YES` do not answer this question** — only the new `--configs` flag on `install` and
`update` does. With no tty and no `--configs` the file is kept and one line says so.

Either answer records the item at the catalog version, so declining is not asked again until the
shipped file itself moves; `update --check` reports those as
`<name> has a new version; update shows the change and asks`. Replacing still leaves the timestamped
`.bak`.

### Build tools

Before installing, tlstore notes which `build=` packages are missing (`pacman -Q`, else `dpkg -s`,
else "is the command there") and installs them. When the plan finishes it asks
`Remove the tools that were only needed for installing (<pkgs>)? [y/N]`, and on yes removes exactly
those (`pacman -R --noconfirm` / `apt remove -y`) and clears `~/.cache/tlstore`. `-y` may answer
this one. `info` shows a `Builds with` line. Only `claude-code` declares one, `patchelf`.

### `nvim-theme`

`docs/en/examples/nvim/lua/launcher/material_palette.lua` (lifted out of `setup-nvim` unchanged) and
`docs/en/examples/nvim/colors/launcher-material.lua` (a real colorscheme that paints the standard
groups, the `@` treesitter captures, diagnostics and git/diff groups from the palette's base16 and
base30 tables, keeps the glass default and falls back to a fixed dark palette when the launcher has
never written wallpaper colours). Both are hidden `file` items required by the visible `nvim-theme`
bundle; Neovim itself is not installed. The colorscheme overrides the palette module's `reload` so a
wallpaper change re-applies it rather than base46's, which only NvChad has.

Enabling it in each config — plain, lazy.nvim/LazyVim, AstroNvim, NvChad — is in `docs/en/Tlstore.md`
rather than the item summary, which stays one sentence.

### `tlstore display`

Runs `$PREFIX/bin/termux-x11-gpu-setup` (installed by the app) with whatever arguments it is given,
and says the app needs updating when the file is not there.

### Pinning

A file in this repository is pinned to a tag when it has not changed since one, otherwise to the
commit that added it (`launcher:<path>@<sha>`). `build-catalog.sh` now also hashes a plain `http(s)`
source by downloading it once, so `fisher` and the fastfetch logo GIF are pinned like everything
else; such a URL must name a tag or commit, never a branch.

### As built

`catalog.tsv` is regenerated at serial 2026090603 and **unsigned** — `catalog.tsv.minisig` was
deleted rather than left describing a file it no longer matches. The maintainer signs the new one
before it ships.

The test suite reads one more documented knob, `TLSTORE_ASSUME_TTY`, because it has no pty to answer
the two questions that are only asked of a person. 512 checks green under `sh`, `dash`, `busybox sh`
and `bash --posix`; `shellcheck -s sh` clean. The colorscheme was checked with `nvim --headless`
0.12, with a wallpaper palette and without one.

`docs/en/examples/fastfetch.jsonc` still names `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/Pictures/gif/skel.gif`
outright, so on the VAJ edition the logo path does not resolve. Left alone here: changing it would
need its own commit and a new pin, and fastfetch's handling of `~` in a logo source is not something
this phase verified.

**2026-09-06**: `docs/en/examples/setup-launcher`, `docs/en/examples/setup-nvim` and
`docs/en/examples/update-setup-launcher-digests.sh` — the scripts this store replaces — were
removed, along with every reference to them (P7).

## Revision 3 (2026-09-21) — hosts, a machine-readable face, a browser, upstream Termux

The developer wants to keep adding terminal tools (the fastfetch GIF patch is the model: special
work to run in Termux), a Pacsea-like browser, and the store on official Termux too. Decided
2026-09-21 without a review page ("not much for me to review, proceed"): TSV contract + fzf browser,
not a compiled TUI; CI signing is a later round.

### Hosts

Three environments run the store. `prefixes` already tells editions apart by `$PREFIX`; it cannot
tell the launcher built as `com.termux` from official Termux, which share a prefix. A second
dimension, the **host**:

| host | how tlstore knows | items that differ |
|---|---|---|
| `launcher` | `TERM_PROGRAM=termux-launcher`; when `TERM_PROGRAM` is unset (ssh), `$STORE_DIR/.installed` exists (the app writes it on every start, nothing else does) | everything |
| `termux` | `TERM_PROGRAM` set to anything else, or unset with no `.installed` | `fastfetch` is out (the GIF logo needs the launcher's kitty graphics); `sigye`, `claude-code`, `kitten`, `fish-shell` stay |

`TLSTORE_HOST=launcher|termux` overrides detection (tests, and a user who knows better). The nix
edition is out of scope: no apt/pacman, and nothing here targets it.

Catalog: new `options` key `host=<comma list of launcher|termux>`; absent means every host. A row
whose host does not match is filtered in `rows()` exactly like the arch filter — never listed,
searched, browsed or installable, `info` says "not in the list". Optional `min-launcher=X.Y.Z`
compares against `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` (the launcher's versionName) and passes when that is unset.
`items.tsv`: both `fastfetch` rows gain `host=launcher`. `doctor` prints an `App` line:
`Termux Launcher 0.2.40 (com.termux)` or `Termux (com.termux)`.

### TSV contract (`--tsv` on list, search, info, update --check)

Tab-separated, no header, no colour, stable column order; product copy stays in `summary` only.

```
list   --tsv [-i|-a]    name  state  version  installed  kind  summary      state: installed|available
search --tsv <query>    same columns as list
info   --tsv <name>     key  value   one row per line info prints (Kind, Version, From, Checksum,
                                     Needs, Builds with, Files, Installed, Summary)
update --check --tsv    name  installed  available  note   note: "" | config-asks | latest
```

Nothing else changes shape. The browser and any later front end read only these.

### `tlstore browse`

`tlstore browse` (and plain `tlstore` on a tty when fzf is present; otherwise usage as today) is
the Pacsea-shaped view built on fzf: the item list on top with `*` for installed, `tlstore info` as
the preview pane, a header line naming the keys. Portrait phones are ~45 columns: preview goes
`down` when `COLUMNS` < 80, `right` otherwise. Keys: Tab marks, Enter installs the marked items
(or the current one), Ctrl-R removes the current item, Ctrl-U updates everything, Ctrl-F refreshes
the list, ? shows the keys, Esc leaves. Actions run outside fzf (its `--expect` returns the key
and the selection; tlstore runs the plan in the terminal so prompts work, waits for Enter, reopens
the view). Without fzf: offer to install it through the package manager as `refresh` does for
minisign; declined → the numbered picker from `install`. Marked items that are already installed
are skipped with one line. `motd.sh` points at `tlstore browse`.

### Standalone install on official Termux

`scripts/tlstore/install.sh`, run as
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher/main/scripts/tlstore/install.sh | sh`.
It refuses outside a Termux prefix (`$PREFIX` under `/data/data/*/files/usr`) and on non-aarch64
says so but continues (pkg items still work). Steps: `pkg install -y minisign` (asks first unless
`-y`/`TLSTORE_ASSUME_YES`); fetch `trusted.pub`, `tlstore` + `tlstore.minisig`, `catalog.tsv` +
`.minisig` from `$TLSTORE_RAW_BASE` (default the raw `main` URL above); verify both signatures
against the fetched key (TLS + GitHub is the trust root, the same as any curl-pipe installer) and
stop on any failure; write `$PREFIX/bin/tlstore` (keeps the `# written by termux-launcher` marker
so the app takes the file over if the launcher is installed later), symlinks `tl`/`tls` only when
those names are free, `$STORE_DIR/{catalog.tsv,trusted.pub}` and `$STORE_DIR/.standalone`
containing the raw base URL. When the launcher is already there (`TERM_PROGRAM=termux-launcher` or
`.installed` present) it says so and changes nothing; a `tlstore` it did not write is refused unless
`-y`. Ends with the doctor line and
`tlstore browse`'s name.

Self-update: on a standalone install (`.standalone` present, `.installed` absent) `tlstore update`
also fetches `tlstore` + `.minisig` from the recorded base, verifies, and replaces itself when the
`TLSTORE_VERSION` line is newer — after the item work, and it re-executes nothing. On the launcher
the app rewrites the script, so self-update is skipped. `sign-catalog.sh` becomes `sign.sh`:
signs the catalog and the script (`tlstore.minisig`, trusted comment `tlstore <version>`).
Tests point `TLSTORE_RAW_BASE` at a `file://` tree.

### Build plan

| phase | branch / worktree | deliverable | depends on | model |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| core | `feat/tlstore-core` / `tl-wt-tlstore-core` | host gating, `--tsv`, `browse`, self-update hook, items.tsv, motd, docs for browse and hosts, tests | — | opus |
| installer | `feat/tlstore-installer` / `tl-wt-tlstore-installer` | `install.sh`, `sign.sh`, installer tests (own file), docs section "On official Termux" | spec only (marker + URL contract above) | sonnet |

Merge order: core, then installer; the orchestrator wires the installer test into `test.sh`, runs
the suite on the merged state, regenerates and signs the catalog. Gate: `scripts/tlstore/test.sh`
all shells green and shellcheck clean; `browse` smoke on Waydroid (pkg items only, x86_64).
Later rounds: CI in `termux-launcher-binaries` (tag → build → SHA256SUMS) and catalog signing on
push; the catalog itself grows item by item.
