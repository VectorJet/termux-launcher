/**
 * The terminal's hold, and everything the finger may do after it. One decision point: a finger
 * that is still at {@link HoldTiming#holdTimeoutMs()} has held, and from there the finger itself
 * chooses between clicking, dragging and selecting text — nothing else is decided by time again.
 *
 * <p>On a terminal that is tracking the mouse the hold hands the finger the mouse: the lift clicks
 * the cell under it, and a drag is a button-held mouse drag when the program asked for motion.
 * Keeping still for longer again takes the hold to its second stage and selects text. A second
 * finger hands both fingers back to the wheel or the pinch, before or after the hold. A plain shell
 * has no mouse to offer, so its hold is text selection at the first stage, as Termux always has.
 *
 * <p>Pure by design — it is fed a touch stream and answers with what the view owes the user, so
 * every row of that grammar is a unit test rather than a thumb on a phone.
