/**
 * Which of the visible rows have to be drawn again this frame.
 *
 * <p>A TUI streaming into the pane changes a handful of rows per frame and leaves the rest exactly
 * as they were, but the render loop has no way to know that: it walks every visible row twice per
 * draw, shaping and measuring text that is already on screen. This is the memory that makes the
 * difference visible — everything one row is drawn from, retained and compared as values, so an
 * unchanged row can be replayed instead of re-derived.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is exact rather than hashed. A hash collision here is a cell that silently
 * stops updating, and the inputs are small: a row's used text, its widths, one style long per
 * column, the two side tables, and the slice of screen-wide state that lands on this row — where
 * the cursor is, what the selection covers. Anything wider than one row (the emulator itself, the
 * geometry, the palette, the scroll position) invalidates every row at once, which is what
 * {@link #beginFrame} decides.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of row draw from image state this class cannot see: a row carrying a bitmap, and a
 * row carrying a kitty placeholder, whose text is stable while the image under it is replaced.
 * Those rows are reported by {@link #rowCarriesAnImage} rather than by {@link #rowChanged}, so the
 * frame that redraws their pixels does not also re-shape their text — the two answers are recorded
 * into different nodes.
 *
 * <p>What those rows draw from is still comparable, one step removed: the emulator stamps each
 * stored image with a generation that moves when its pixels do. A row remembers the images it was
 * last recorded from and their stamps ({@link #noteRowImage}), and {@link #rowImagesMoved} asks
 * whether any of them has moved since — so an animation costs a row's image node once per frame
 * of the animation rather than once per frame of the display.
 *
 * <p>This class knows nothing about how a row is drawn or what it is drawn into — see
 * {@link TerminalRowNodes} for that half.
