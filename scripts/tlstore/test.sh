#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Host tests for app/src/main/assets/tlstore/tlstore. No framework: a sandbox
# HOME, a fake prefix, a catalog whose sources are file:// URLs, and a list of
# assertions. Nothing here touches the network, a device or the real HOME.
#
#   scripts/tlstore/test.sh [shell...]
#
# With no arguments it runs the whole suite under every POSIX shell it can find
# (sh, dash, busybox sh, bash --posix) — tlstore has to work under all of them,
# and dash is what Termux's sh is. Name shells to run only those, e.g.
#   scripts/tlstore/test.sh /bin/dash "/path/to/busybox sh"
#
# Two knobs let the suite exercise phone-only code paths on a Linux host, and
# tlstore reads both by design:
#   TLSTORE_ARCH=aarch64   — binary and npm-musl items are hidden on other
#                            processors; the fixture sets this so they show up.
#   TLSTORE_PATCHELF=true  — the npm-musl install runs patchelf on the
#                            downloaded executable. The fixture payload is a
#                            shell script, so patchelf would (rightly) refuse
#                            it; `true` stands in and the rest of the path —
#                            registry document, sha512, extraction, loader,
#                            wrapper — is exercised for real. Nothing else is
#                            stubbed: curl, sha256sum, sha512sum, tar, base64,
#                            od and minisign are the real tools.
#   TLSTORE_ASSUME_TTY=1   — the questions tlstore only asks a person (replace
#                            this config file? remove the build tools?) are
#                            skipped when stdin is not a terminal. The suite has
#                            no pty, so it sets this knob and pipes the answers
#                            in; without it the "nobody is there" paths are what
#                            get tested, and both are.
#   TLSTORE_HOST=launcher  — which app the store is running in. The suite also
#                            drives the detection itself, through TERM_PROGRAM,
#                            TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION and the marker file the app
#                            writes, and checks all three.
#   TLSTORE_FZF=no-such-fzf — the fzf command. There is no pty here, so the
#                            full-screen view cannot run; pointing this at a
#                            name that is not there tests what people without
#                            fzf get instead.
#   TLSTORE_RAW_BASE       — the top of the repository a hand-installed tlstore
#                            reads; the suite points it at a file:// tree laid
#                            out the way this one is.
# The catalog signature tests need minisign. Without it they are skipped, and
# the suite says so instead of passing quietly.
