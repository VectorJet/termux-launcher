/**
 * The kitty graphics Tier-2 image store: decoded images kept by client-chosen id so later
 * {@code a=p} commands can place them without retransmission.
 *
 * <p>All methods run on the terminal's serialized update thread. An image is {@link #reserve}d
 * synchronously when its transmission completes — that fixes its id, number, dimensions, and byte
 * budget while the pixel decode still runs on the worker — and {@link #complete}d when the decoded
 * bitmap arrives. A placement command later in the stream can therefore resolve the image and its
 * dimensions synchronously even though the pixels may still be in flight.</p>
 *
 * <p>The store is bounded in both image count and decoded bytes, and a full store answers
 * {@code ENOSPC} rather than evicting: escape sequences are untrusted input, and a client that
 * wants space back has the delete forms. Animation frames are the one exception — see
 * {@link #reclaimFrameBudget} — because they are the only content whose loss degrades an image
 * instead of removing it. Byte accounting uses explicit counts so the bookkeeping is testable on
 * the JVM, where {@link Bitmap} methods return defaults.</p>
