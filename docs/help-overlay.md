# Help overlay — spec (approved on the review page 2026-09-14)

A help layer the user opens from a **?** button on every corner tab. It dims the screen, boxes
each visible control of the place the wall rests on, and connects each box to a short hint with
a leader line that crosses nothing. It is measured live when it opens, so anything not on screen
is left out. The first-boot tour (`docs/first-boot-tour.md`) teaches gestures once; this overlay
is there every time. Wireframes and the inventory it is built from: `docs/help-overlay-inventory.md`
and the review page `.lavish/help-overlay-inventory.html` (sections "Help overlay wireframes").

## Decisions

- **Entry.** A `?` button joins every corner tab: the terminal pane's
  (`TerminalPaneController`, one button on a lone pane → two; three in a split → four; two when
  maximised → three), the Display page's (`X11PaneFrame`: power, cog, ?) and the Widgets page's
  (`WidgetPaneFrame`: cog, pencil, ?; the grid-size read-out while editing keeps ? too). Tapping it
  dismisses the tab and opens the overlay for the current place.
- **Coverage.** Every control the place owns, tour-taught or not. Chrome shared by all three
  places (dock, A–Z row, extra keys, stats) is taught on the **Terminal** overlay only. The
  Display and Widgets overlays carry their own controls plus the status bar. (The Display stats
  hint is kept unless the developer says otherwise.)
- **Measured live.** Candidate controls are measured when the overlay opens and on every layout
  pass while it is up, the way `tour/TourViewTargets` does (`findViewById`, on-screen check,
  rect in overlay coordinates, keyboard key rects through the activity's key probe). A control
  that is gone, zero-sized or off-screen is omitted with its hint: a disabled stat, the closed
  keyboard, the touchpad with mouse mode off, the + on Display, the badge on Widgets. Nothing is
  positioned by hand.
- **Boxes.** A dashed border inset 2 dp inside each measured rect, rounded to the control's own
  corner. Width-spanning rows (dock, A–Z) are boxed whole. The extra keys row is **not** boxed
  as one: see below.
- **Extra keys.** Each key is labelled in place on its own cap: tap action on the first line,
  swipe-up secondary on the second, read from the row the user actually has (`ExtraKeysView`
  children and their key definitions, `TermuxTerminalExtraKeys` for what `tool:` ids do). Short
  product labels per tool id: keyboard.cycle_form "form", mouse.toggle "Mouse", wall.widgets
  "Widgets", wall.terminal "Terminal", wall.display "Display", pane.split "Split", window.new
  "window", session.browser "Sessions", session.new "session"; plain keys use their display
  glyph. Secondary line shown as "↑ <label>".
- **Hints.** One card per box: bold title and one or two short lines, product voice, no
  mechanism (AGENTS.md "User-facing text"). Cards live in the wall band, in two columns, in the
  vertical order of their controls. Same card surface and theme tokens as `TourOverlayView`,
  place accent, font scale respected.
- **Leader lines.** Orthogonal, at most two bends. A control above the wall sends its line
  straight down to its card; a control below sends it up from an end cap through an **edge lane**
  (a 12 dp gutter each side, one line per lane); a control beside the wall connects sideways.
  The router (`HelpLeaderRouter`, pure Java, unit-tested) checks every segment against every
  box, card and existing line and moves a card down a slot when a crossing would occur. Cards
  that will not fit go to a second page of the overlay (pill "1 / 2", tap flips) rather than
  overlap.
- **Chrome.** A scrim dims the screen. The overlay **consumes every touch** (unlike the tour)
  and closes on any tap outside a card, on Back, on a place change, and when the activity
  pauses. A "Tap anywhere to close" pill sits in the free band. Re-measure on every layout pass
  (rotation, keyboard, font scale, dock style); landscape rail and side columns come through the
  same measurer.
- **Out of scope.** Animation beyond a fade; gesture demonstrations; persistent state; a Settings
  entry; launcherctl tool.

## Second pass (2026-09-14, from the phone)

- No hint about the corner tab or the pane corners: the user reached the help through that tab.
- The status bar box spans the whole bar, not the peeking place icon at its end.
- A quick reference, not a manual: the windows chips and the + are one hint; the keyboard's
  bottom row (chords and space-bar swipes) is one hint; every line is as short as it can be and
  the cards are tighter. The tables below are superseded where they differ.

## Third pass (2026-09-14): colour pairs, one page

Each hint has its own colour, shared by the dashed box on the control and the border and title of
its card (`HelpPalette`: hues spread evenly from the place accent). That pairing is the whole link,
so no leader lines are drawn and nothing can cross; cards flow down two columns of the wall band
in screen order, each in the column nearer its control, yielding to the key labels, the footer
and the boxes of controls inside the band unless nothing fits otherwise (`HelpLeaderRouter.arrange`).
A second page starts only when both columns are full, which the default layouts never reach.

From the phone, same day: leaders are back, drawn in the pair's colour (straight when the card
faces its box, one elbow when beside it); cards sit where the eye looks for them (`HelpLeaderRouter.arrange`:
under a control above the wall, over one below it, beside one inside it, cascading a little along
an edge, sliding away from the control when the spot is taken); and the keyboard is two hints again, the prefix keys (Ctrl and Alt,
with the chords they start) and the space bar (its swipes).

## Fourth pass (2026-09-15): help by topic

From issue #36 (the revised onboarding review), landed on top of the third pass above.

- **Terminal opens on a chooser; Home and Display still open straight into the overview.**
  `HelpPresentationModel.TERMINAL_DEFAULT_MODE` is `TOPICS`; `WIDGETS_DEFAULT_MODE` and
  `DISPLAY_DEFAULT_MODE` are both `OVERVIEW` — Display's value is a placeholder for the screen
  check the spec still owes, not a considered choice.
- **Groups.** Every catalogue entry (`HelpTopics.Entry`) carries a `Group`: Everyday, Keyboard,
  Multitasking. The chooser lists Everyday first. Display and Home have no Keyboard or
  Multitasking topics at all — their catalogues are Everyday-only.
- **Show basics / Show all.** `showBasics()` filters the chooser to the Everyday group;
  `showAll()` drops into the overview from its first page. Neither is a gesture on the launcher.
- **Overview paging.** The "1 / 2" pill is replaced by Previous and Next (`previous()`, `next()`,
  each clamped at its end) and a section label naming the group of the page's first entry
  (`sectionLabelRes()`), drawn by `HelpOverlayView` in place of the pill.
- **Close.** An explicit close request (`close()` → `Effect.CLOSE`) alongside the outside-tap
  dismiss the third pass already drew (`help_close` pill).
- **Show gesture.** `showGesture()` asks the renderer for a finite demonstration over the
  selected topic's control, and leaves help open (`Effect.demonstrate`), only when that control
  is on screen (`canShowGesture()`). The spec has the renderer draw a static directional cue
  instead of the finger trace when the system animator scale is zero (`ReducedMotion`); the trace
  itself is the tour's, drawn through the shared `TourFingerPainter`.
- **Try it.** `tryIt()` closes help and hands the topic's lesson id to practice
  (`Effect.practice`), only for a topic with both a measurable control and a lesson
  (`canTryIt()`). `TourController.startPractice(lessonId)` runs that one lesson alone: Done/End
  practice instead of the lesson's three buttons, clears on the lesson's own signal, and writes
  nothing to the tour's prefs, so practising can never finish, restart or skip the stored run.
- **Reading never acts.** `open`, `selectTopic`, `backToTopics`, `showBasics`, `showAll`,
  `previous`, `next` and `remeasure` all answer `Effect.NONE` — browsing help changes only the
  model's own state, never the launcher's.
- **Colour identity from the catalogue.** `overviewColor` derives a box's colour from the entry's
  fixed position in the place's whole catalogue (`identityIndex`, `HelpTopics.sizeFor`), not from
  whichever subset happens to be measurable this pass, so a control keeps its colour with the
  keyboard up or down. Topic mode instead wears the place accent (`topicHighlightColor`).
- **Missing targets are explained, never redirected.** `highlightTargetId()` answers null rather
  than another control's rect when the topic's own control cannot be measured; `revealRes()`
  supplies the catalogue's "how to bring it back" line and `relatedTopicId()` an optional related
  topic — never a substitute rect.
- **Palette and Settings entries.** The spec adds a Help entry to the command palette (app
  category, tool `app.open_help`) and to Settings beside Replay the tour (`EXTRA_SHOW_HELP`), both
  reaching the activity's one `showHelpOverlay()`.
- **Accessibility.** The spec asks for focus and a topic announcement when help opens, and a
  label on every button (Close, Previous, Next, Show gesture, Try it); the panel takes focus and
  announces the topic title, and every button carries a content description.
- **Overview stays the third pass's.** `keys` and `corners` are topics in the chooser only: the
  overview keeps per-key labels on the extra keys row with no box round it, and no corner-tab card
  (the second pass dropped that hint because the reader reached help through that tab).
- **Hands off to the tour.** The `corners` topic's lesson is `find_help`
  (`TourRun.FIND_HELP` — see `docs/first-boot-tour.md`), so "Try it" there and the tour's
  own first lesson are the same three taps.

## Fifth pass (2026-09-15, from the phone): guide first, catalogue on demand

From the phone, on top of the fourth pass. Where the two differ, this one wins: it supersedes the
fourth pass's default-mode lines and every paging line above.

- **Every place opens on the guide.** The per-place default constants and `defaultMode` are gone;
  `open()` always lands on `OVERVIEW`. The catalogue is a second question, asked only by the reader
  who wants it.
- **The guide carries no chrome.** No header, no Close, no Show topics, no Previous or Next, no
  section label, and no footer reserved at the bottom of the band. That reservation is what pushed
  the A–Z hint onto a second page on Terminal, and Display and Home were offering Previous and Next
  over a single page of their own.
- **The guide is one page.** `pageCount`, `page`, `previous`, `next`, `setPageCount`,
  `sectionLabelRes` and `sectionLabelResFor` are gone from the model. A hint the router cannot fit
  on the page is left out of the guide and logged under `TermuxHelp`; its topic is still in the
  catalogue, so nothing is lost, only unpinned from a control.
- **Two floating buttons.** `HelpOverlayView` draws them in every mode, beside where the ? the user
  pressed was: a × that closes help, and a book (`CornerTabGlyphs.CATALOGUE`) that opens the topic
  chooser and, pressed again, puts it away and leaves the guide standing. They are the diameter of a
  corner-tab button inside a 48 dp square, in the tab's own glass and tint, kept inside the overlay,
  and named "Close help" and "Help topics".
- **The anchor.** `show(place, anchor)` takes the ? in screen coordinates:
  `TerminalPaneController.helpButtonRectOnScreen` on Terminal, and a method of the same name on
  `X11PaneFrame` and `WidgetPaneFrame`, each reading `PaneControlsView.actionBounds(ACTION_HELP, …)`
  while the tab is still out. All three corner tabs therefore run help before they dismiss
  themselves, and the activity reads the anchor before it dismisses the tabs. No anchor — Settings,
  the palette — falls back to the active pane's corner zone, or the wall's top-trailing corner.
- **The popup keeps its own buttons** — Show basics, Show all, the topic chips, Back to topics,
  Show gesture, Try it — and its header is the title alone: the × glyph is help's one close. Show
  all dismisses the popup and returns to the guide.
- **Tap outside** any card, panel or glyph closes help, in every mode. Taps on cards, the panel,
  chips and glyphs still never reach the launcher.
- Strings dropped: `help_previous`, `help_next`, `help_overview_page`, `help_show_topics`,
  `help_close`. Added: `help_close_glyph`, `help_close_action`, `help_topics_action`.
- The tour is untouched: lesson 1 ("Close help to continue") is satisfied by the × or an outside
  tap, and `TourViewTargets` HELP_BUTTON still measures the corner tab's ?.
- **Leaders never overlap or touch.** `HelpLeaderRouter.arrange` now picks the card position and
  its leader together: every segment must clear every other leader on the page by the gap (12 dp),
  parallel runs allowed, lanes stepped sideways across the card's and the box's own width, one
  elbow when they differ. A control boxed in on every side keeps its card where the eye looks and
  draws no line, the colour pairing carrying the link, rather than spilling a page.

Superseded by the topic catalogue (fourth pass): Sessions badge → `sessions`; Window chips and +
→ one `windows` topic (issue #36 asks the highlight to cover both); Status bar → `status`; Stats
cluster → `stats`; Pane corner → `corners`; Divider → `divider`; Dock → `dock`; A–Z row → `az`;
Extra keys → `keys`; Ctrl + Alt → `prefix` (the basics) plus `shortcuts` (the full chord
reference, moved to Multitasking); Space bar → `space` (the palette gesture only). Terminal opens
on the chooser now; this table is still what "Show all" renders.

Superseded by the topic catalogue (fourth pass): App chips → `windows` (the display-apps
strings); Stats cluster → `stats`; Status bar → `status`; Scale rail → `scale`; Touchpad →
`touchpad`; Start display → `start`. Corner tab has no catalogue entry — the fourth pass drops it
as a topic on Display.

#### Display topic catalogue (`help_topic_…`, verbatim from `strings.xml`)

| Empty space | the largest empty cell region of the grid | Empty space | Long-press to add a widget or another page. | any empty cell |

Superseded by the topic catalogue (fourth pass): Status bar → `status`; A widget → `widget`;
Empty space → `empty`. Corner tab has no catalogue entry, as on Display. The catalogue enum stays
`PaneWallPage.WIDGETS`; the copy itself already says Home, not Widgets (`ab869d92`), matching
`CONTEXT.md`'s place name.

#### Home topic catalogue (`help_topic_…`, verbatim from `strings.xml`)

| Id | Group | Purpose | Action | Reveal |

## Code shape

New package `com.termux.app.help`:

- `HelpTopics` — the one catalogue of every control help explains, pure: a stable id per place
  (the id `HelpTargets` measures the control under), a `Group`, purpose/action/reveal string res
  ids, an optional lesson id from `TourRun.lessons()`, an optional related topic id, and an
  `identityIndex` that pins the entry's overview colour. `forPlace`, `entry`, `sizeFor`, `all`.
- `HelpPresentationModel` — what help is showing and what it wants done about it, pure: a mode
  (`OVERVIEW`, the guide every place opens on; `TOPICS`; `TOPIC`), the selected topic and the
  basics filter. Commands (`open`, `selectTopic`, `backToTopics`, `showBasics`, `showAll`,
  `showGesture`, `tryIt`, `close`, `remeasure`) return an `Effect` (`NONE`, `DEMONSTRATE`,
  `CLOSE`, `CLOSE_AND_PRACTICE`); queries answer what to render, including the one target to
  highlight and its colour. Reads `HelpTopics`; renders nothing and measures nothing itself.
- `HelpOverlayView` — scrim, boxes, in-place key labels, cards, leader lines, the topic popup and
  the two floating glyph buttons; consumes touches; `show(place, anchor)`, `dismiss()`, re-measures
  on global layout like `FirstBootTour.obtainOverlay` does. Renders `HelpPresentationModel` by mode,
  the guide on one page (fifth pass).
- `HelpTargets` — the per-place candidate list and their measurement, reusing the `ViewFinder`
  idea from `tour/TourViewTargets` (do not couple to the tour's classes; copy the two helpers if
  needed).
- `HelpLeaderRouter` — pure: given overlay size, target rects with their side (ABOVE, BELOW,
  LEFT, RIGHT, INSIDE) and card sizes, returns card positions, polylines and page assignment
  with the no-crossing guarantee. Deterministic.
- `HelpCopy` — titles and lines from resources; extra key label table.
- Debug log tag `TermuxHelp` (mirror `tour/TourLog`).

Entry wiring: a `HELP` action on each of the three corner tabs, routed to one activity method
`showHelpOverlay()` that reads the ? off whichever tab is up, dismisses every tab and opens the
overlay for `currentWallPlace()` with that rect as its anchor.
Dismiss on Back through the activity's existing back handling, on `onWallPageSettled`, on
`onPause`.

## Acceptance

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/.local/opt/jdk21 PATH=$HOME/.local/opt/jdk21/bin:$PATH
./gradlew :app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests 'com.termux.app.help.*'
./gradlew --stop
```

Router tests must cover: the three default portrait layouts as synthetic rects produce no
crossing segment and no overlapping card; a missing target is omitted with its card; more cards
than fit go to page 2; each edge lane carries one line; a control with no free slot in its column
falls to the other column before it falls to page 2. Strings are one plain sentence each.

Git: commit on `feat/help-overlay` in small commits, never push, never touch `dev`, no devices
or emulators. Stop the Gradle daemon when done (this machine is short on RAM).
