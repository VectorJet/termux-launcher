# LauncherCtl API (Local AI Endpoint)

## Overview
LauncherCtl is a localhost HTTP server that exposes an OpenAI- and Ollama-compatible inference endpoint, model management for the on-device Termux AI (TAI) runtime, one app-launch route, and the pane routes that let a process in a shell open and drive a terminal pane of its own. It is not a general device-control or agent bridge.

- Server: in app process, isolated from native model work which runs in `:tai_runtime`.
- Bind mode: `localhost` (default, `127.0.0.1`) or opt-in `lan` (`0.0.0.0`).
- Auth: bearer token from `~/.launcherctl/token`, or `X-Api-Key: <token>` header. The token can be made optional for localhost (see [Auth](#auth)).
- Endpoint URL: `~/.launcherctl/endpoint`.
- CLIs: `$PREFIX/bin/tai` for local AI and `$PREFIX/bin/launcherctl` for `launcherctl launch <app name, package, or activity>` and `launcherctl pane …`. The launcher app installs both when `TermuxActivity` starts.
- Removed helpers: `launcherctl-mcp` and `launcher-restart` are no longer installed and are deleted on upgrade.

`tai` uses this authenticated server for the local Termux AI endpoint; native AI runtime work is isolated in `:tai_runtime`.

## Files and Components

- Server implementation:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/termux/launcherctl/LauncherCtlApiServer.java`
- App startup wiring:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/TermuxActivity.java`
- Manifest service entry:
  - `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Runtime files under `$HOME/.launcherctl`:

- `token`: API bearer token.
- `endpoint`: local base URL (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`).

TAI model packages live under app-private model storage, not under `~/.launcherctl`.

## Discovery

Read the active endpoint and token from the two files the app writes on startup:

```sh
BASE=$(sed -n '1p' ~/.launcherctl/endpoint)   # e.g. http://127.0.0.1:41237
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.launcherctl/token)
```

The first line of `~/.launcherctl/endpoint` is the active base URL. OpenAI-compatible clients expect `/v1` appended; Ollama-compatible clients use the base address as-is.

If the files are missing, open Termux Launcher once so the server starts and writes them.

## Auth

Authentication uses a bearer token. Send it with either header:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `X-Api-Key: <token>`

The token is a startup-generated random secret stored owner-only at `~/.launcherctl/token`. Comparison is constant-time.

### Token-optional toggle (localhost only)

A setting **Require API token** (default **on**) lives under **Settings → Services & permissions → TAI · Termux AI**. When turned **off**, requests from localhost need no token — any placeholder API key (or none) works. This is convenient for local CLI clients that cannot easily read the token file.

- `GET /` and `OPTIONS` never require auth, regardless of the toggle.
- **LAN bind mode always requires the token**, no matter the toggle state. Anyone who can reach a LAN-exposed endpoint and does not present the token gets `401`.

Rotate the token with `POST /v1/auth/rotate`, which rewrites `~/.launcherctl/token` and `~/.launcherctl/endpoint`.

## CORS, Host checks, and Health

Browser clients are accepted only when the page itself came from loopback. A request carrying an
`Origin` header is served — and granted CORS by echoing that origin back — only if the origin host is
`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, or `::1`; any other origin gets `403 forbidden_origin`, token or no token.
Requests with no `Origin` at all (curl, the OpenAI SDKs, the shell helpers) are unaffected: the bearer
token governs those.

The `Host` header must name an address the server actually bound — a literal IP, or `localhost`. A
request naming any other hostname gets `403 forbidden_host`. This is what stops DNS rebinding, where a
remote page points its own hostname at `127.0.0.1` so the browser treats the API as same-origin.

- `GET /` — returns `Ollama is running` with HTTP 200. No auth. Used by clients to detect a live Ollama-compatible server.
- `OPTIONS` — CORS preflight. No auth, but subject to the origin and host checks above.

## Endpoint Reference

The complete route surface is below. App launch is the only non-TAI action route. There are no notification, media, resource, event, agent, MCP, restart, or general device-control routes.

### Health and discovery

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| GET | `/` | no | Health check, body `Ollama is running` |
| OPTIONS | any | no | CORS preflight |

### App launch

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/v1/apps/launch` | Match and launch one app from the launcher's app catalog |

The request body contains one non-empty query:

```json
{"query":"maps"}
```

The query may be an app label, package name, activity name, or partial match. Exact package,
activity, and stable-id matches rank first. Exact labels rank next, followed by prefix and
substring matches. The best unique match launches and returns HTTP 200:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "query": "maps",
  "label": "Maps",
  "packageName": "com.example.maps",
  "activityName": "com.example.maps.MainActivity",
  "stableId": "com.example.maps/com.example.maps.MainActivity#user=0",
  "userId": 0,
  "clonedProfile": false
}
```

No match returns HTTP 404 with error code `not_found`. Several matches tied at the best rank return
HTTP 409 with error code `ambiguous` and a `candidates` array containing up to eight app records.
An empty query returns HTTP 400 with `bad_request`. A matched app that Android cannot start returns
HTTP 500 with `launch_failed`.

A query that matches a Linux (X11) desktop app runs it on the embedded display instead of starting
an Android component; the display starts first if it was off. This route never goes through the
terminal action dispatcher, so it does not need the launcher in the foreground either, and the X
server and any apps already running on it keep going whether or not the terminal is on screen — the
display's rendering surface simply detaches while the Display page is not the one showing and
reattaches on its own once it is again.

The route allows 30 requests per minute. The installed shell client reads the endpoint and bearer
token from `~/.launcherctl`, then sends this request:

```sh
launcherctl launch maps
launcherctl launch com.example.maps
```

`launcherctl`'s other command is `pane`, below. Use `tai` for model and inference commands.

### Panes

These routes exist so that something running inside a shell — an AI coding agent, a build, a
script — can open a pane of its own to show its work in, the way it would open a browser tab, and
drive that pane whether or not the user is currently looking at the terminal. Every route runs as
one terminal action on the UI thread. The launcher does not need to be in the foreground: it only
needs to be running at all, which covers a plain app switch (the user opened something else, or
the screen is off) as well as the terminal actually being on screen. `activity_not_running` (HTTP
409) means the launcher process itself is not there to ask — it was killed, or the Activity was
destroyed and nothing has recreated it yet — not merely that another app is in front right now.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/panes` | List the windows and panes of the current session |
| POST | `/v1/panes` | Open a new pane in the current window |
| POST | `/v1/panes/{id}/focus` | Switch to the pane's window and focus it |
| POST | `/v1/panes/{id}/write` | Type text into a pane opened through this API |
| GET | `/v1/panes/{id}/text?lines=N` | Read the last `N` transcript lines of a pane opened through this API |
| POST | `/v1/panes/{id}/close` | Close a pane opened through this API |

**Ownership is the security boundary.** Opening a pane marks it as owned by the API; `write`,
`text` and `close` answer HTTP 403 `not_owned` for any other pane, including every shell the user
opened by hand. `GET /v1/panes` and `focus` work on all panes. The token therefore buys a pane, not
the user's shells — which is why these routes could come back after the general remote-action
endpoints were removed.

`POST /v1/panes` takes:

```json
{"command": ["kitten", "icat", "out.png"], "cwd": "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/proj",
 "title": "preview", "focus": false, "tag": "claude-code"}
```

- `command` — an argv array, or a string that is run through `sh -c`. Omit it for a plain shell.
  The command runs through the user's login shell (so their `PATH` applies) and the shell stays
  behind when the command exits, exactly like a restored workspace pane.
- `cwd` — defaults to the home directory. `title` — the session name shown on the pane.
- `focus` — default `true`; `false` leaves the keyboard where the user has it.
- `tag` — a free-form label (agent name, task id) that `GET /v1/panes` reports back.

Under the `dwindle` pane layout the new pane halves the focused pane along its longer side; under
the other layouts it splits along the window's longer side and the retained layout re-tiles.

Every pane record looks like:

```json
{"id": "6d3f…", "title": "~/proj", "name": "preview", "cwd": "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/proj",
 "pid": 12345, "running": true, "columns": 80, "rows": 24, "focused": false,
 "agent": {"tag": "claude-code", "command": ["kitten", "icat", "out.png"], "openedAt": 1756569600000}}
```

`agent` is `null` for panes the user opened. `GET /v1/panes` returns
`{"windows": [{"index", "id", "name", "current", "focusedPane", "panes": […]}], "activePane", "layout"}`.
`write` takes `{"text": "…", "enter": true}` (at most 16 KiB per call; `enter` appends a carriage
return) and answers 409 `pane_not_running` once the shell has exited. `text` accepts `lines` from 1
to 500 (default 60). An unknown id is HTTP 404 `pane_not_found`; a pane that could not be opened
(no session, terminal limit reached, compatibility mode on) is HTTP 409.

Rate limits per minute: list 240, open 30, focus 120, write 240, text 240, close 60.

The shell client wraps all of this:

```sh
id=$(launcherctl pane open --title preview --no-focus -- kitten icat out.png \
     | sed -n 's/.*"id":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
launcherctl pane write "$id" --enter 'make test'
launcherctl pane read "$id" --lines 40
launcherctl pane list
launcherctl pane focus "$id"
launcherctl pane close "$id"
```

`launcherctl pane write` reads the text from its arguments, or from stdin when none are given.
Every `pane` command prints the server's JSON body and exits 1 on an HTTP error, so the error code
(`not_owned`, `pane_not_found`, …) is always visible to the caller.

### The on-screen keyboard

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/v1/keyboard/show` | Raise the in-app keyboard |
| POST | `/v1/keyboard/hide` | Put the in-app keyboard down |

Both take `{"source": "manual"}` (the default) or `{"source": "focus"}`. `manual` is the user
asking. `focus` says a text field took focus, which is a signal rather than an order: on the
Display place it goes through the same rules a tap there does — see
[The keyboard follows text fields](X11_Display.md#the-keyboard-follows-text-fields) — and
elsewhere it simply opens or closes the keyboard. Both put something on a screen, so a stopped
launcher answers 409 `activity_not_running`; 409 `unavailable` means the in-app keyboard is off.
Rate limit: 240 a minute each.

```sh
launcherctl keyboard show --source focus
launcherctl keyboard hide --source focus
launcherctl keyboard show          # source=manual
```

### OpenAI-compatible

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/models` | List installed, loadable models with TAI metadata |
| GET | `/v1/models/{id}` | Return one model object (filtered from `/v1/models`) |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | Chat completions: text, image/audio input, tools, SSE streaming |
| POST | `/v1/responses` | Stateless OpenAI Responses adapter (text/image input, function calls/results) |
| POST | `/v1/completions` | Legacy text completions, SSE streaming |
| POST | `/v1/embeddings` | Embeddings for models advertising `text_embeddings` |
| POST | `/v1/audio/speech` | Always returns `unsupported_audio_output` (HTTP 501) |

OpenAI `/v1/*` streaming uses Server-Sent Events (`text/event-stream`) and ends with `data: [DONE]`.

#### `GET /v1/models` metadata

Each entry in the standard OpenAI-shaped `data` array includes TAI-specific metadata prefixed with an underscore so existing OpenAI clients ignore it:

- `_backend`: backend routing for the model, currently `litert-lm` (default LiteRT-LM runtime) or `mnn-llm` (bundled MNN backend).
- `_capabilities`: ordered list of endpoint capability strings, for example `text_chat`, `image_input`, `audio_input`, `tool_use`, or `code`. This is what the installed APK can currently serve and is identical to `_endpoint_capabilities`.
- `_source_capabilities`: informational upstream/package capabilities. Clients should not treat these as enabled endpoint features.
- `_default_max_output_tokens`, `_endpoint_context_window`, and `_source_context_window`: runtime default, the context window TAI serves on this device, and the model's own limit. The endpoint window grows with device RAM up to the model's limit and follows the **Context window** setting when one is set; see [Termux AI backends](Termux_AI_Backends.md#context-window-sizing).
- `_tool_mode`: present for tool-capable models. MNN tool support is `prompt_fallback` (the model's own chat template renders the tools when it can, TAI's prompt otherwise); LiteRT tool support is native when advertised.

`GET /v1/models/{id}` returns the single matching object (HTTP 404 if unknown).

#### `POST /v1/embeddings`

OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint. Only models that advertise `text_embeddings` in their `/v1/models` `_capabilities` array are accepted; others return `capability_not_supported`. `input` may be a string or an array of strings, and the response returns one OpenAI `embedding` item per input in the same order. Local output is float vectors only; `encoding_format:"base64"` is rejected with `unsupported_encoding_format`.

LiteRT EmbeddingGemma `.tflite` installs require `sentencepiece.model` in the same model directory. New downloads fetch that sidecar automatically. Older installs that only contain the `.tflite` return `embedding_tokenizer_missing` until the model is re-downloaded or the sidecar is added.

### Ollama-compatible

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/version` | Compatibility version |
| GET | `/api/tags` | List installed models |
| POST | `/api/show` | Show one model's details and capabilities |
| GET | `/api/ps` | Show the loaded model |
| POST | `/api/chat` | Chat and tool calls, NDJSON streaming |
| POST | `/api/generate` | Prompt-style generation, NDJSON streaming |
| POST | `/api/embed` | Create embeddings when supported |
| POST | `/api/embeddings` | Legacy alias: `{model, prompt}` in, `{embedding: [...]}` out |
| POST | `/api/pull` `/api/create` `/api/push` `/api/copy` `/api/delete` | Return HTTP 501 (not emulated) |

Ollama `/api/chat` and `/api/generate` stream newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) by default. Ollama registry operations (`pull`, `create`, `push`, `copy`, `delete`) are not emulated because Ollama/GGUF packages are not LiteRT-LM or MNN packages. Install models from the TAI catalog or import flow instead.

### Model management

These routes are used by the `tai` CLI and the Settings UI. They share the same auth as the inference routes.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/ai/status` | Overall status, settings, and limitations |
| GET | `/v1/ai/runtime` | Loaded model and runtime state |
| GET | `/v1/ai/models` | Detailed TAI model registry |
| GET | `/v1/ai/models/downloads` | Show download progress/history |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/import` | Register a supported local package |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/download` | Download a model from a URL |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/download-catalog` | Download a catalog model |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/downloads/cancel` | Cancel an active download |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/delete` | Delete an installed user model |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/load` | Load a model into the registry slot |
| POST | `/v1/ai/models/unload` | Unload a model from the registry slot |
| POST | `/v1/ai/runtime/preflight` | Check whether a model can load safely |
| POST | `/v1/ai/runtime/load` | Load a model into the active runtime |
| POST | `/v1/ai/runtime/unload` | Unload the active model |
| POST | `/v1/ai/runtime/keep-warm` | Keep a model loaded temporarily |
| POST | `/v1/ai/runtime/cancel` | Cancel active generation |
| POST | `/v1/auth/rotate` | Rotate the API token and rewrite discovery files |

`POST /v1/ai/runtime/preflight` checks ABI, API level, bundled native libraries, model package readability/format, memory, accelerator policy, and known backend history without touching native LiteRT-LM/MNN runtime code.

## Streaming Notes

- OpenAI endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/responses`) use SSE (`text/event-stream`) and terminate with `data: [DONE]`.
- Ollama endpoints (`/api/chat`, `/api/generate`) use NDJSON: one JSON object per line, final object flagged `done: true`.
- Non-streaming requests return a single JSON body.

## Rate Limiting

Each protected route has its own token-bucket rate limiter. When a bucket is exhausted the server returns HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After: <seconds>` header indicating when the bucket refills. The error body uses the standard error envelope (see below).

Limits are per-route, not global, so heavy generation traffic does not starve unrelated management calls.

## Error Envelope

OpenAI-style routes (`/v1/*`) return a nested OpenAI error object:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "model not loaded",
    "type": "model_not_loaded",
    "code": null
  }
}
```

Ollama-style routes (`/api/*`) return a flat error string in the Ollama convention:

```json
{
  "error": "model not loaded"
}
```

Rate-limit errors use `type: "rate_limit_error"` on `/v1/*` and the same flat `error` string on `/api/*`. HTTP status codes follow OpenAI/Ollama conventions (`400`, `401`, `404`, `409`, `429`, `500`, `501`).

## Terminal LLM Client Configuration

TAI exposes OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints so terminal clients such as `aichat`, `aider`, `tmuxai`, or any tool that reads `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` can drive the local model runtime.

Default bind mode is `localhost` (server bound to `127.0.0.1`). With the **Require API token** setting on (default), the bearer token is required for every protected request. Token and endpoint URL are written to:

```sh
~/.launcherctl/token
~/.launcherctl/endpoint
```

Pass the endpoint as `OPENAI_BASE_URL` with `/v1` appended:

```sh
BASE=$(sed -n '1p' ~/.launcherctl/endpoint)
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.launcherctl/token)
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="$BASE/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="$TOKEN"
```

Do not echo `$TOKEN` into shell history. Prefer reading it from the file at call time or storing it in a credentials manager.

If you turned **Require API token** off for localhost use, any placeholder key works:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="local"
```

### Example: list and call a LiteRT model

```sh
MODEL=$(curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models" | jq -r '.data[] | select(._backend=="litert-lm") | .id' | head -n1)
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}]}" \
  "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/chat/completions"
```

### Example: call an MNN model

MNN models route through the bundled MNN backend. Only models whose `_backend` field equals `mnn-llm` should be requested via MNN. Current MNN catalog models are chat/code models; image, audio, and embeddings requests are rejected unless the model advertises that endpoint capability.

```sh
MODEL=$(curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models" | jq -r '.data[] | select(._backend=="mnn-llm" and (._capabilities | index("text_chat"))) | .id' | head -n1)
[ -n "$MODEL" ] && curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply exactly OK\"}]}" \
  "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/chat/completions"
```

Inspect `/v1/models` first to confirm both `_backend == "mnn-llm"` and the endpoint capability you intend to use are present.

## Security Model

### Attack Surface
- Localhost API reachable from local device processes.
- Token theft enables API calls.
- Inference output may reflect model/package content.

### Bind Mode
- Default: `localhost` — server bound to `127.0.0.1`. Only processes on the device can reach the API.
- Opt-in: `lan` — server bound to `0.0.0.0`. Any device on the local network can reach the API. **LAN mode always requires the token** even when the localhost token-optional toggle is off.
- LAN exposure is time-boxed: 12 hours after it is enabled the server rebinds to `127.0.0.1` and rotates the API token. Requests arriving after the window closes get `403 lan_session_expired`. The endpoint settings JSON carries `lanSessionStartedAt`, `lanSessionExpiresAt`, and `lanSessionExpired`.

### Mitigations Implemented
- Bearer token auth (or `X-Api-Key`), startup-generated random token.
- Constant-time token comparison.
- Token-optional toggle only loosens localhost auth; LAN always enforces.
- Bounded worker pool (prevents unbounded thread growth).
- HTTP parser limits:
  - request line size,
  - header line size/count,
  - max body size.
- Per-route token-bucket rate limiting (`429` with `Retry-After`).
- Token rotation endpoint.
- Sensitive files written owner-only.
- CORS grants only to loopback origins (echoed back, never a wildcard); cross-origin browser requests are refused outright.
- `Host` header validated against the bound address, which closes the DNS-rebinding path into the loopback listener.
- LAN exposure expires after 12 hours and rotates the token on the way out.
- Media referenced by chat requests is bounded: local paths must resolve under the Termux home or shared storage (never `~/.launcherctl`), and remote URLs must resolve to public addresses, re-checked at every redirect hop.

### LAN Opt-In Considerations
- LAN mode (`bindMode: lan`) is opt-in and surfaces a `lanWarning` field in the endpoint settings JSON plus the `tai` CLI help text.
- Treat the bearer token as a network secret whenever LAN mode is active. Do not paste it into shell history, screenshots, or shared notes.
- Rotate the token (`POST /v1/auth/rotate`) after temporarily enabling LAN mode if the token may have been observed.
- A firewall on the LAN, a per-call `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, and short-lived sessions are recommended for any non-trivial LAN use.
- LAN mode is unencrypted: requests are plain HTTP, so the bearer token is visible to anyone on the network. Treat every LAN session as one where the token has already been observed — that is why the window expires and rotates on its own.

### Remaining Security Considerations
- Localhost token auth still depends on local process trust.
- If same app UID ecosystem is compromised, token can be read.
- LAN mode trusts every device on the local network; it does not implement per-device authentication, and it carries the token in cleartext.
- Consider Unix domain sockets for tighter local access boundaries in future.
- The pane routes' exposure window is now the launcher process's lifetime, not just its time on
  screen. This does not add capabilities — ownership still confines `write`/`text`/`close` to panes
  opened through the API, and nothing here can bring the launcher to the Android foreground on its
  own — but the same token now reaches a pane for longer.

## Troubleshooting

### Token errors (`401`)
- Read the current token: `cat ~/.launcherctl/token`.
- Rotate it with `POST /v1/auth/rotate` or from **Settings → Services & permissions → TAI · Termux AI → Recreate API token**, then re-run your command.
- If you turned **Require API token** off, confirm you are still on `localhost` bind mode — LAN mode always requires the token.

### `Connection refused`
- Reopen Termux Launcher so the server starts.
- Check `~/.launcherctl/endpoint` for the current port.
- Run `tai status`.

### Rate limited (`429`)
- Wait for the `Retry-After` interval and retry.
- Space out polling loops; limits are per-route.

## Performance Notes

- The server is request-driven and avoids polling loops.
- Inference is offloaded to the isolated `:tai_runtime` process; the launcher UI/API process stays alive if the native runtime crashes.
- Only one chat/generation model is resident at a time; switching models unloads the previous one.
