# Nix Package Management

The **Nix edition** (`com.termux.launcher.nix`) replaces the APT package
manager with [Nix](https://nixos.org) in a
[Nix-on-Droid](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid)-style
environment. Instead of `pkg install`, packages come from the official
`nixpkgs` collection — tens of thousands of prebuilt packages served from
`cache.nixos.org`, independent of any Termux repository.

The launcher itself is unchanged: same terminal, palette, panes,
keyboard, and `launcherctl`/`tai` tooling as the Termux edition.

## How it works

On first launch the app downloads a bootstrap that contains the Nix
package manager and a minimal shell. Every session then runs inside a
[proot](https://proot-me.github.io/) that maps the app's private
directory to `/nix`, so unmodified upstream binaries (glibc, not Android
libc) run as-is and the official binary cache applies.

**No emulation is involved** — this is not QEMU. Every binary is native
`aarch64` code executing directly on the CPU. proot is a
ptrace-based supervisor that intercepts syscalls only to rewrite
*paths*: nixpkgs binaries hardcode `/nix/store/...` locations that an
Android app cannot own, so proot translates `/nix`, `/bin`, `/etc` and
`/usr` to the app's private directory on the fly (the real Android
system stays visible at `/android`). The cost is a small
syscall-interception overhead — noticeable in `fork`/`exec`-heavy
workloads, irrelevant for compute — not the instruction-translation
cost of an emulator.

## Getting started (first launch)

1. Install the nix-edition APK and open it. The app downloads and
   unpacks the bootstrap (~38 MB) on its own — no interaction needed.
2. The first terminal session asks:

   ```
   Do you want to set it up with flakes? (y/N)
   ```

   Answer **`y`**. Flakes are what the shell template below uses, and
   the flake setup is the tested path.
3. The first generation now builds on the device. Expect minutes on a
   recent phone and up to ~35 minutes on an old one. The
   `evaluating derivation ...` phase prints nothing for a long time —
   that is normal, it is not stuck. Keep the app in the foreground
   (Android cuts the app's network in the background).
4. You have a `bash-5.3$` prompt when it finishes. That is the stock
   environment; continue below to get the full shell setup.

## Shell environment (fish, oh-my-posh, eza/zoxide/yazi, LazyVim, fastfetch)

The fork ships a ready-made flake template that recreates the launcher's
reference shell — the same fish config, oh-my-posh Material themes, and
CLI stack the examples in this wiki use. Replace the minimal first-boot
files with it:

```sh
cd ~/.config/nix-on-droid
rm flake.nix nix-on-droid.nix        # the minimal files from first boot
nix flake init -t github:PickleHik3/nix-on-droid/launcher-nix#launcher
nix-on-droid switch --flake ~/.config/nix-on-droid
```

Open a new session afterwards: fish is the login shell, prompt themed,
`eza`/`zoxide` wired in.

The template's layout — **which file owns what matters**:

| File | Module type | What goes here |
|---|---|---|
| `flake.nix` | flake wiring | inputs (nixpkgs, home-manager, the fork), overlays |
| `nix-on-droid.nix` | system module | `environment.packages`, `user.shell`, `android-integration` |
| `home.nix` | home-manager module | `home.packages`, dotfiles (`xdg.configFile`), activation hooks |
| `toolkits.nix` | plain booleans | which groups `home.nix` installs — see below |
| `config/` | plain files | the actual `config.fish`, oh-my-posh themes, `fastfetch/config.jsonc`, the logo GIF |

The split exists because two different configuration systems are wired
together. `nix-on-droid.nix` is evaluated by nix-on-droid's own module
set and manages the *environment* — everything outside your home
directory: the login shell, `/etc`, base packages every script assumes,
Android glue like `termux-setup-storage`. `home.nix` is evaluated by
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) (embedded
via the `home-manager.config` bridge in `flake.nix`) and manages *your
user*: dotfiles, per-user packages, activation hooks, session
variables.

Rule of thumb: a file under `~/.config` or a tool only you invoke →
`home.nix`; the login shell, a base CLI everything expects (git, curl,
sed), or Android integration → `nix-on-droid.nix`. `flake.nix` is where
the two meet — it owns the inputs, the overlays, and the wiring.

Do **not** paste `home.nix` contents into `nix-on-droid.nix` or vice
versa: `home.*` options and `lib.hm` only exist inside home-manager, so
the switch fails with `error: attribute 'hm' missing` /
"option `home' does not exist". System options and home options live in
different files by design.

### Choosing what gets installed: `setup-toolkits`

The template groups its packages into toolkits, and `toolkits.nix` is the
file that says which ones you want. `setup-toolkits` is a checklist over
that file — it flips the booleans and runs the switch, which is exactly
what you would do by hand:

```sh
setup-toolkits
```

```
  Toolkits — /data/data/com.termux.launcher.nix/files/home/.config/nix-on-droid/toolkits.nix

    ✓  shell         fish, oh-my-posh, eza, zoxide, yazi, fd, ripgrep, fzf
    ✓  eye-candy     fastfetch with the animated GIF logo, timg, chafa
    ✓  editor        neovim + setup-nvim (implies build tools)
    ✓  build         cc, make, cmake, autotools, pkg-config, binutils — build from source
    ✗  node          nodejs, npm, npx (npm -g installs into ~/.npm-global)
    ✗  go            go (go install writes ~/go/bin)
    ✗  python        python3, uv, uvx (uv tool install writes ~/.local/bin)
    ✗  animated-logo patched fastfetch so the GIF animates — compiles ~20 min on device

      1) everything            every toolkit above except the animated logo
      2) shell essentials      shell + eye candy, nothing else
      3) pick one by one
      4) quit, change nothing
```

Option 3 walks the list and Enter keeps whatever a toolkit is set to
now, so it doubles as a way to change one thing without answering for
the rest.

Non-interactive forms:

```sh
setup-toolkits --list                    # current selection, no changes
setup-toolkits --all                     # everything prebuilt (not the animated logo)
setup-toolkits --essentials              # shell + eye candy only
setup-toolkits --enable node,go          # leaves every other toolkit as it is
setup-toolkits --disable eyeCandy
setup-toolkits --enable python --no-switch   # edit the file, switch later yourself
```

The defaults are shell, eye-candy, editor and build on; node, go and
python off, because a toolchain nobody asked for is a few hundred MB of
download. `editor` implies `build`: a Neovim distro compiles treesitter
grammars on first launch.

Editing `toolkits.nix` in `nvim` is equally valid, and the two cannot
disagree — the script reads the same file it writes. Only the booleans
matter to `home.nix` and `flake.nix`; comments are yours.

Adding packages that are not in any toolkit stays a `home.nix` edit, as
always — the toolkits are a starting set, not a boundary.

### Global installs: `npm -g`, `go install`, `uv tool`

The one place where "the file is the system" needs help is the *other*
package managers. Their default global prefix is the nix profile, which
is a read-only store path that the next switch replaces — `npm install
-g` fails outright there, and anything that did land would disappear at
the next `nix-collect-garbage`.

So the template redirects each of them into your home directory and puts
the result on `PATH`:

| Tool | Global installs land in | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `npm install -g`, `npx` | `~/.npm-global` (`bin/` on PATH) | `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` |
| `go install` | `~/go/bin` | `GOPATH`, `GOBIN` |
| `uv tool install`, `uvx` | `~/.local/bin` | uv's own default |

Those directories are outside nix's bookkeeping, which is the point:
they survive switches, rollbacks and garbage collection. The flip side
is that nix cannot reproduce them on another phone — if you want a tool
on every device, put it in `home.nix` instead, and use the global
installs for the long tail nixpkgs does not carry.

Two device-specific notes:

- **Native npm modules** (`node-gyp`) need a compiler: keep the `build`
  toolkit on, or `npm install -g` fails on any package with a C
  addon.
- **uv does not manage Pythons here.** Its downloaded interpreters are
  `python-build-standalone` builds that expect a distro loader at
  `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1`, which does not exist inside the proot —
  the failure looks absurd ("no such file or directory" for a file that
  is plainly there). The template therefore sets
  `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never` and `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-system`, so
  uv uses the nix `python3` from the `python` toolkit. `uv venv`,
  `uv pip`, `uv tool install` and `uvx` all work against it; only
  `uv python install` is off the table. For a different Python version,
  add it to `home.nix` (`python312`, `python313`) and point `uv --python`
  at it.

### Building from source

The `build` toolkit is the equivalent of a `base-devel` group: `gcc`,
`make`, `cmake`, `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, `pkg-config`,
`binutils`, `patch`, `gettext`, `file`, and the `tar`/`gzip`/`xz`/`unzip`
archivers. That is enough to `./configure && make && make install` an
ordinary source tree on the phone.

Libraries to build *against* deliberately stay out of the global
profile: they are per-project, and a global `zlib` does not give you the
headers anyway. Ask for them per shell:

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#zlib.dev nixpkgs#openssl.dev nixpkgs#sqlite.dev
```

Inside that shell `pkg-config --cflags zlib` resolves, and the shell ends
when you type `exit` — nothing is installed. `nix develop` does the same
thing from a project's own flake, and is the better habit for anything
you build more than once.

Expect compilation to be slower than the CPU suggests: proot intercepts
syscalls, and `configure` scripts are thousands of tiny `fork`/`exec`
pairs. `make -j$(nproc)` still helps; a serial `configure` is just slow.

### Neovim / LazyVim

The template installs LazyVim along with everything `:checkhealth lazyvim`
asks for. If your config predates that — `nvim` reporting a missing
`tree-sitter (CLI)`, `fzf` or `lazygit` — add them to `home.nix` yourself
and switch:

```nix
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  tree-sitter   # error without it: treesitter cannot install grammars
  fzf           # pickers
  lazygit       # the <leader>gg keymap
  python3       # lazy.nvim's hererocks builds luarocks with it
  imagemagick   # snacks.image renders more than plain PNGs; optional
];
```

Two environment fixes belong with it. Nothing in the bootstrap sets a
locale, so glibc runs in the `C` locale and neovim reports "Locale does not
support UTF-8" — which also mangles box-drawing glyphs everywhere else in
the shell. And `xdg-open` does not exist inside the proot, so `gx` and
anything else opening a URL silently fails, even though Android can handle
it:

```nix
home.sessionVariables.LANG = "C.UTF-8";   # built into glibc, no locale archive needed

home.file.".local/bin/xdg-open" = {
  executable = true;
  text = ''
    #!/bin/sh
    exec termux-open "$@"
  '';
};
home.sessionPath = [ "$HOME/.local/bin" ];
```

One more, in `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua` — that file is yours, not
the template's, so an existing install needs it by hand:

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
  rocks = { enabled = false },
  -- ...
})
```

lazy.nvim's own health check says "no plugins require `luarocks`, so you can
ignore any warnings below" and then reports an error anyway, because with
rocks on it still wants to build hererocks on the phone. Turning them off
removes both.

Clipboard integration has no fix here: no clipboard tool exists inside the
proot, so neovim's `"+` and `"*` registers stay unavailable. `trash`, `gs`,
`tectonic` and `mmdc` are likewise absent — snacks.image degrades to the
formats it can render itself, and deletions are permanent.

### Animated fastfetch logo

The template ships the GIF: the first switch copies a small animated
launcher logo to `~/Pictures/gif/skel.gif`, which is the path
`config/fastfetch/config.jsonc` points at. The file is a plain writable
copy — replace it with any GIF of your own (`cp yours.gif
~/Pictures/gif/skel.gif`, no switch needed) and an existing file is
never overwritten. fastfetch falls back to text output if the path goes
missing.

Stock nixpkgs fastfetch draws only the first frame. Full animation over
the kitty graphics protocol needs the patched build, which the template
carries as `overlays.nix` and turns on from `toolkits.nix`:

```sh
setup-toolkits --animated-logo
```

or, by hand, `animatedFastfetchLogo = true;` and a switch. There is no
binary cache entry for a patched fastfetch, so it compiles on the device
— serial build, roughly 20–50 minutes depending on the phone, app
foregrounded. Everything else about the logo works without it.

### SSH into the phone

The template ships a small sshd toolset (`sshd-tools.nix`), declarative
where it matters and manual where you want control:

```sh
sshd-start            # start (idempotent); generates the host key on first use
sshd-stop             # stop
sshd-status           # running state, port, autostart arming
sshd-autostart on|off # arm/disarm starting it with new interactive sessions
```

Nothing starts unless you run `sshd-start` yourself or explicitly arm
`sshd-autostart on`. Details:

- Port **8023** by default (the Termux edition's sshd conventionally
  owns 8022 on the same device); override by writing a number to
  `~/.config/sshd/port`.
- Key-only auth. Append your client's public key to
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, then `ssh -p 8023 nix-on-droid@<phone-ip>`.
- The ed25519 host key lives in `~/.ssh/hostkeys` — generated on
  device, never part of the nix store.
- Server log: `~/.config/sshd/log`. The server does not survive a
  reboot or an app force-stop; reopen the app and it comes back with
  the next session if autostart is armed.
- If you run sshd by hand instead: it must be invoked by absolute path
  (it re-execs itself), needs `-o StrictModes=no` on Android, and a
  port above 1024.

### After a switch

- Open a **new session** to pick up the new login shell and PATH.
- `launcherctl` and `tai` live in the proot's `/bin`; the template's
  `config.fish` puts that on the PATH for fish sessions.
- Something broke? `nix-on-droid rollback` restores the previous
  generation.

## Everyday commands

Quick, imperative package management:

```sh
# search the package set
nix search nixpkgs ripgrep

# install / remove for your user profile
nix profile install nixpkgs#ripgrep
nix profile remove ripgrep

# list what's installed, upgrade everything
nix profile list
nix profile upgrade --all

# try a tool without installing it
nix run nixpkgs#cowsay -- moo
nix shell nixpkgs#nodejs   # temporary shell with node in PATH
```

## Declarative setup (recommended)

The system environment lives in `~/.config/nix-on-droid/nix-on-droid.nix`.
Add packages there and rebuild — the config *is* your installed system,
reproducible and rollback-able:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  environment.packages = with pkgs; [
    fish
    neovim
    ripgrep
    eza
  ];

  user.shell = "${pkgs.fish}/bin/fish";
}
```

Apply with:

```sh
nix-on-droid switch --flake ~/.config/nix-on-droid
```

Roll back to the previous generation any time:

```sh
nix-on-droid rollback
```

## Graphical apps

Graphical Linux apps work on this edition, and they arrive the same way
everything else does: name them in the config and switch. There is no
`pkg install`, no extra repository, and nothing to copy from the
launcher's **Get GUI apps** screen — that screen builds a command for the
Termux edition's two routes, neither of which exists here.

Add the app, and `xkeyboard-config` alongside it:

```nix
environment.packages = with pkgs; [
  xfce.mousepad      # a text editor with a window
  feh                # an image viewer
  xkeyboard-config   # the display server will not start without it
  openbox            # gives windows their title bars — see below
  font-misc-misc     # only for older X programs — see below
];
```

```sh
nix-on-droid switch --flake ~/.config/nix-on-droid
```

`home.nix`'s `home.packages` works just as well — both end up in the same
profile, which is what the launcher reads.

Come back to the launcher and the app is in the app drawer under **Linux
apps**, with the name and icon the package itself ships. Tap it: the
display starts if it is not already up, and the app opens on it. Nothing
is written to a file and there is no command to run in the terminal.

### What does not work yet

Two things to know before you pick an app:

- **Programs that drop privileges do not start.** `xterm` is the one
  everybody tries first, and it opens, connects and then quits with
  `spawn: setuid() failed`. Android refuses that call inside an app's own
  processes, and the nixpkgs build does not give it up the way Termux's
  does. There is nothing to configure around it. For a terminal window on
  the display, use a GTK or Qt one instead — `xfce.xfce4-terminal` works.
- **Windows open unmanaged until openbox is added.** Without a window
  manager a window arrives where the app puts it, with no title bar and
  nothing to move or resize it by. Add `openbox` and the launcher starts
  it with the display for you — there is no command to run and no
  configuration to write; it uses the launcher's own, which gives every
  window the whole screen.

`xkeyboard-config` is a one-time thing, and it is the whole of the
display's setup. Until it is installed the Display place says so and
keeps its start button hidden, because the X server exits on startup
without that keyboard data. It is data rather than a program, so it does
not show up on `PATH` and there is nothing to run — the launcher finds it
in the store and points the server at it after each switch.

### Fonts for older X programs

`xclock`, `xeyes`, `xmessage` and their relatives ask the display server
for a font by name — `-misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-…` and the like
— and quit with `cannot load font` when the server has none. The server
carries only its own built-in `fixed` and `cursor`, so one package makes
the difference:

```nix
font-misc-misc
```

Switch, and the launcher hands the server that store path the next time
it starts one. **GTK and Qt apps need none of this** — they draw their
own text — so skip it unless something refuses to open with a font
complaint.

Add `font-misc-misc` on its own. `font-cursor-misc` looks like its
companion and cannot go beside it: both ship a `misc/fonts.dir`, and a
switch with the two of them fails on the collision. The cursor font is
built into the server, so nothing is missing without it.

An old program with a way around it of its own — a flag asking for a
modern Xft font instead of a server one — can say so in the `Exec=` line
of a `.desktop` file you write yourself, and then needs no font package
at all.

A few notes:

- **Enable the display first.** **Settings → Display → Linux display**
  turns it on. The Display place is where the apps open.
- **Every switch is picked up on its own.** The store path changes each
  time; return to the launcher and the drawer is already right.
- **Terminal programs with a menu entry** — `vim`, for instance, ships
  one — open in a terminal pane instead of on the display. That is the
  entry saying `Terminal=true`, and it is the same on every edition.
- **A blank tile** means the package's icon is in a format the launcher
  does not read. PNG and SVG are used; older X programs often ship XPM,
  and get the default tile.
- **Fonts.** A bare nixpkgs environment has none beyond what the app
  itself carries. Add `dejavu_fonts` if an app comes up with boxes
  instead of text.

## Housekeeping

```sh
# reclaim disk from old generations and unused store paths
nix-collect-garbage --delete-old
```

## Differences from the Termux edition

| | Termux edition (`com.termux`) | Nix edition (`com.termux.launcher.nix`) |
|---|---|---|
| Package manager | `pkg` / APT | `nix` / `nix-on-droid` |
| Package source | Termux repos (bionic builds) | official `nixpkgs` (glibc builds, via proot) |
| Install command | `pkg install foo` | `nix profile install nixpkgs#foo` |
| Config-as-code | — | `nix-on-droid.nix` + flakes |
| Rollbacks | — | `nix-on-droid rollback` |
| Termux:API tools | native | available; some tools need the `/android` prefix for system binaries |

## Tips and caveats

- Everything runs under proot: a small syscall-translation overhead
  applies, mostly noticeable in process-heavy workloads.
- Compiling large packages on-device works but is slow — prefer cached
  binaries, and keep the app in the foreground during long downloads or
  builds (Android cuts background network for the app).
- The Android system is visible at `/android` inside the environment.
- First-run bootstrap and the environment defaults come from this
  project's [nix-on-droid fork](https://github.com/PickleHik3/nix-on-droid).

Nix is a deep tool — the [official Nix manual](https://nix.dev) and the
[nix-on-droid wiki](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid/wiki)
