# Settings map

Open Settings by long-pressing inside the terminal and choosing **Settings**. You can also long-press
the app icon in another launcher and choose the **Settings** shortcut.

This map uses the current top-level labels. Use **Search settings** at the top when you know what you
want but not where it lives. Search indexes the preferences inside every destination, so `fonts`,
`ligatures`, or `Shizuku` can find the containing section.

## Layout

Three doors, **Home**, **Terminal** and **Display**, each opening the Layout editor on that place —
the same editor a corner tab or the long-press menu opens. A Portrait/Landscape toggle above the
place's miniature switches which orientation you are arranging; the real screen behind the editor
follows what you change only for the orientation you are actually holding the phone in. Done and
Discard let you keep or throw away everything you changed in that visit.

- **Status bar** and **Apps row**: drag either on the miniature to the edge you want it on, or into
  the hide tray to hide it. **Alphabets row** shows or hides the A–Z index below the pinned apps,
  and only while the apps row is along the bottom. **Extra keys**: drag to where the terminal's
  extra keys should stand, or into the tray to hide them. A column down the left or the right is a
  landscape arrangement; in portrait the rows stand along the bottom or not at all.

The status bar can stand on the top or the bottom in portrait, and on any of the four edges in
landscape; it is never hidden, so the swipe that moves between places always has somewhere to live.
At the top it is the bar you already know. At the bottom it sits on the dock and shares its look,
growing upward when you open it, with the clock at its foot and the window pills along its upper
edge. On the left or the right of a landscape screen it becomes a narrow column: the place badge, one chip per window, and the system readings
stacked down it, with the clock written hour over minutes when the column is open. Whichever edge
it stands on, a swipe along the bar moves between places — sideways on a bar across the top or
bottom, up and down on a column, where Home is above Terminal and Display below it — and a swipe
across the bar opens and closes it. A column shares its edge with the pinned apps and the extra
keys when those stand there too: the status bar takes the top of that edge and the rest follows
underneath.
- **Dock height** and **Keyboard height**: how tall the dock and the built-in keyboard stand, and
  **Keyboard bottom padding** for the clearance it leaves below the keyboard, each set separately
  per place and per orientation; upgrading carries your current values over unchanged.
- **Keyboard on enter**: whether the on-screen keyboard comes back the way you left it, opens, or
  stays closed when you switch to this place. Remembered per place, the same in both orientations.
  On Home the keyboard opens over the page rather than shrinking it, so the widgets keep their
  places; a text field inside a widget opens the Android keyboard, and the keyboard key on the
  extra keys row opens the built-in one.
- **Keyboard type**: whether the on-screen keyboard is docked along the bottom, floats over the
  content where you put it, or is split in the middle for two thumbs. Remembered for this place
  and orientation, and reachable from a key or the command palette as well.
- **Grid columns** and **Grid rows** (Home only): how many widgets fit across and down a page, set
  separately for portrait and landscape; widgets that no longer fit a smaller grid move to free
  space or a new page rather than being dropped.

## Look

Use this section for visible surfaces and colors:

- **Appearance:** tune the dock, keyboard, status panel, and terminal while looking at the real
  home screen. Tap the floating palette to style every surface at once, or tap a surface to style
  it on its own. This edits the shared look every place starts from; a look that differs between
  Home, Terminal and Display is edited by opening **Appearance** from the long-press menu while
  on that place.
  The keyboard's **BG opacity** applies to the keyboard docked under the terminal — a floating,
  split, or overlaying keyboard is a solid panel and ignores it — while its **Edges** apply to
  every keyboard.
- **Terminal fonts:** install one of fourteen curated multi-face families with pinned SHA-256
  verification and visible license information, enable Nerd Font icons, choose ligature behavior,
  and adjust weight where supported.
- **Color mode:** follow the system, force light, or force dark mode.
- **Use wallpaper colors:** build the launcher palette from the Android wallpaper.
- **Interface colors:** choose whether the dock, status bar, app drawer, in-app keyboard and command
  palette follow the wallpaper palette or the terminal color scheme in
  `~/.termux/colors.properties`. Needs Android 11 or newer, and a scheme on disk — apply one from
  Termux:Styling first. See [Theming from a color scheme](#theming-from-a-color-scheme).
- **Terminal contrast:** choose Softer, Default, or Harder for the generated wallpaper palette.
- **Tools that follow the terminal colours:** pick the command-line tools that should be recolored
  with the terminal. See [Tools that follow the terminal colours](#tools-that-follow-the-terminal-colours).
- **Wallpaper:** show or hide the system wallpaper behind launcher surfaces.
- **Icon appearance:** monochrome icons, system or custom icon pack, and pinned-app icon behavior.
- **Keyboard look:** **Theme**, **Keyboard colors**, and **Typeface** for the built-in keyboard,
  **Bottom padding** to lift its bottom key row away from the edge of the screen (Layout sets the
  same padding per place and orientation), and **Customize keyboard appearance** for live size,
  spacing, radius, and color tuning. These rows are only enabled while the built-in keyboard is the
  chosen input method on the **Keyboard** page.

The font picker writes its managed selection to `~/.termux/fonts.d/10-launcher.conf`. **Use font.ttf
/ Termux:Styling** removes that one managed config; it does not delete your own `fonts.conf` or
downloaded families.

The launcher exports its resolved roles to `~/.termux/material-colors.sh` and `.properties` —
including container/on-container pairs, tertiary, error-container, and outline roles for prompts and
scripts — whether the palette came from the wallpaper or from a color scheme.

Beside them, a wallpaper palette also writes `material-colors-dark.sh` / `.properties` and
`material-colors-light.sh` / `.properties`: the same keys for each mode, so a script can dress
itself for the mode the phone is not in yet. The two files without a mode in the name stay the
palette in use right now.

### Tools that follow the terminal colours

Pick a tool in this list and the launcher writes its theme file whenever the palette changes, then
wires it into that tool's own config. Turning one off puts the config back as it was. Tools that can
reload live do; the rest pick the colors up the next time they start. Built in: Starship, Helix,
tmux, bat, Yazi, fzf, lazygit, Oh My Posh, Neovim, fish and herdr, a terminal workspace manager whose
accent, panes and status line follow along. The fish entry colors the command line you type on.

The palette itself keeps up on its own: it re-renders whenever your wallpaper, Material colour, or
system dark/light mode changes, so a tool on this list never shows yesterday's contrast.

You can add your own. A template is a directory in `~/.termux/theme-templates/<id>/` holding a
`template.properties` manifest, the file to render, and its hooks:

```properties
name     = Starship
summary  = Prompt palette
input    = starship.toml
output   = ~/.config/launcher-material/starship.toml
post_hook = apply.sh
undo_hook = undo.sh
```

Templates in that directory apply because they are there — they need no switch — and an id that
matches a shipped template replaces it. `output` understands `~`, `$VAR` and `${VAR}`, with
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` defaulting to `~/.config` and `~/.cache`.

The input file is plain text with `{{ colors.<token>.<mode>.<format> }}` placeholders — for example
`{{ colors.primary.dark.hex }}`. Tokens are the key names in `~/.termux/material-colors.properties`,
mode is `default` for the palette in use and `dark` or `light` for those modes' own colors (a
palette with only one mode gives it for all three), and the formats are `hex`,
`hex_stripped`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `red`, `green` and `blue`. `{{ mode }}` renders `dark` or `light`.
Everything else in the file is left exactly as written, so a Go or Lua template survives intact. An
unknown token or format skips that template and logs why; nothing is written.

An optional `setup_hook` names a script for a tool that is only switched on by a line in your shell
startup file, which the launcher never edits for you. Turning such a tool on offers you the command
— `bash "<template dir>/<setup_hook>"` — to copy and run in the terminal once; it adds that line.

`post_hook` runs after the file is written, `undo_hook` when the template is turned off or removed.
Both are run as `bash <hook>` from the template directory with `TERMUX_THEME_ID`, `TERMUX_THEME_DIR`,
`TERMUX_THEME_OUTPUT` and `TERMUX_THEME_MODE` set, and are stopped if they take longer than thirty
seconds. Write them to be repeatable: add one include line or a marker block, change nothing when
nothing changed, and have the undo remove exactly what the apply added. The theme name used
throughout is `launcher-material`.

### Theming from a color scheme

Set **Interface colors** to *From terminal color scheme* and the whole interface is derived from
`~/.termux/colors.properties`, the file Termux:Styling writes. The scheme is the anchor, not a seed:
`background` becomes the surface, `foreground` becomes the text color, `color4` (or a distinctly
colored `cursor`) becomes the accent, `color1` the error color, `color8` the divider color. Only the
tones the scheme has no opinion about — container elevations and their text colors — are derived, as
a lightness ladder off the background with contrast repaired afterwards.

Changing a scheme in Termux:Styling recreates the activity and repaints everything. The setting is
unavailable below Android 11, where the palette cannot be loaded into a running activity; the
terminal itself still follows the scheme there.

Any derived color can be overridden in `~/.termux/launcher-theme.properties`, one token per line:

```properties
# accent from the scheme's yellow instead of its blue
primary                = color3
surface_container_high = lighten(surface, 0.08)
outline_variant        = mix(on_surface, surface, 0.78)
scrollbar              = alpha(on_surface_variant, 0.3)
inverse_primary        = #d79921
```

A value is a hex color, a scheme key (`background`, `foreground`, `cursor`, `color0`-`color15`),
another token name, or `lighten` / `darken` / `mix` / `alpha` over any of those. Amounts accept
`0.25` or `25%`. Unparsable lines are ignored and logged; the rest of the file still applies.

The tokens are `surface`, `surface_dim`, `surface_bright`, `surface_container_lowest`,
`surface_container_low`, `surface_container`, `surface_container_high`, `surface_container_highest`,
`on_surface`, `on_surface_variant`, `outline`, `outline_variant`, `scrollbar`, `primary`,
`on_primary`, `primary_container`, `on_primary_container`, and the `secondary`, `tertiary` and
`error` families spelled the same way, plus `inverse_surface`, `inverse_on_surface` and
`inverse_primary`.

## Terminal

Use this section for terminal geometry, panes, and how the launcher behaves as an app:

- **System keyboard compatibility:** workaround for Android system keyboards, padding the layout so
  the terminal and key rows stay visible above the on-screen keyboard.
- **Full screen:** hide Android system bars while using the launcher.
- **Show in Recents when not the default launcher**.
- **Split-pane controls:** enable native windows, panes, and their tmux-style shortcuts. Turning this
  off returns to single-pane compatibility behavior and closes secondary panes, so finish their work
  first.
- **Automatic tiling:** new windows start in the `dwindle` layout — every new pane halves the focused
  one along its longer side, a dragged pane takes the half you drop it on. Off by default; any window
  can still pick a layout with `Ctrl+Alt+L`.
- **Focused pane grows:** the pane you tap (or focus with `Alt+Arrow`, or an agent focuses) takes
  most of the room and the others slide aside, focus.nvim-style. Tap between an agent's pane and the
  pane it drives to switch which one is big. Turning it off puts every divider back to 1:1.
- **Let scripts open panes:** whether `launcherctl pane …` and the `/v1/panes` routes of the local
  API may open and drive panes. On by default; off answers those routes with 403.
- **Battery → Lazy mode:** stop the launcher animating while you are only looking at it. The clock
  swaps its digits instead of folding them, a working window's rim holds lit instead of breathing,
  the status readings sample less often, and the weather icon rests on its last frame. Nothing on
  screen repaints until something actually changes.

**Please try Lazy mode.** Without it the launcher redraws every frame the panel offers, purely to
animate the clock's seconds — that is a real battery cost for something nobody is watching most of
the time. The intent is to make it the default once it has been through enough hands; what that
needs is people running it on other devices and reporting anything that looks stuck, stale, or
wrong — a clock that stops updating, a status reading that freezes, a rim that never lights.
[Open an issue](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher/issues) if you find one.

## Status bar

Use this section for the top row's clock and readouts. Its surface — blur, opacity, grain, and
radius — is tuned per place in Appearance, opened from the long-press menu on that place.

- **Clock style**, **Clock alignment**, and **Use 12-hour time**.
- **CPU usage**, **Memory usage**, and **Weather** status cards.
- **Media and pinned notifications** and their essential notification rules.

The expanded status panel's clock opens Android's clock app and its cog opens Settings. Window pills
also show CPU-based working state and bell-based attention state; those indicators need no toggle.

Weather requires location permission. Tap the weather value in the status row for details and the
Open-Meteo attribution.

## Keyboard

- **On-screen keyboard:** built-in terminal keyboard, Android keyboard, or none.
- **Hide the on-screen keyboard:** hide it while a physical keyboard is connected.
- **Edit extra keys:** the terminal key row, previewed as it will look. Add common keys
  such as CTRL with one tap, search for any other key or launcher action, drag keys to
  reorder them, give a key a swipe-up action, a label and a colour, and start from presets
  including the classic Termux row. Page two of the row is edited on the same screen. **Go to
  Widgets**, **Go to Terminal**, **Go to Display** and **Mouse mode** are among the actions a key
  can carry.
- **Key colours:** a key can be given one of eleven colours, or left with the row's own styling.
  Nine of them follow your theme, so they change with dark mode and with the colours the launcher
  takes from your wallpaper; black and white stay as they are. Pick a colour in the key editor, or
  open the Appearance editor, touch the keyboard, and tap the key itself. Out of the box the three
  place keys are coloured, so Widgets, Terminal and Display are easy to tell apart.
- **Keys that do nothing where you are get dimmed.** The key row follows you between Widgets,
  Terminal and Display, and a key with nothing to act on goes faint and stops responding until you
  move somewhere it works. Nothing is removed or rearranged, so the row always looks the same. On
  **Terminal** every key works. On **Display** everything works except keys that manage panes,
  windows and sessions. On **Widgets** you keep the place keys, the keyboard key, the sessions key
  and anything belonging to the launcher itself — settings, help, the command palette, the layout
  and appearance editors, the wallpaper, launching an app — while typing keys, modifiers, Paste,
  Scroll and the terminal's own tools are dimmed.
- **Extra keys:** choose editing and navigation keys shown on the built-in layout.
- **Custom layout:** load `~/.termux/keyboard/layout.xml`.
- **Learn where you tap:** off by default. The keyboard learns where your taps land on each key
  and nudges presses near a boundary toward the key you usually mean. Only letters, digits and
  punctuation are ever moved; Enter, Backspace, Ctrl and the other action keys are not. **Forget
  learned taps** clears what it has learned. It stores per-key averages only, never what you typed.
- **Keyboard type:** docked, floating or split, on every place at once, for the orientation you
  are holding the phone in. The **Layout** editor is where one place is given a type of its own, and
  this row shows no choice while the places disagree.
- **Floating keyboard width**, **Floating keyboard height** and **Split keyboard gap**: how much
  of the screen a floating keyboard takes, how tall it is, and how far apart the halves of a split
  one sit. All three are set separately for portrait and landscape; which type a place uses is
  chosen in the **Layout** editor. A floating keyboard can also be resized in place by dragging the
  handle in its bottom-left corner: out to the left makes it wider, up makes its rows taller, and
  the edges you are not holding stay where they are. It writes the same two values.
- **Layout documentation** and **Supported key values**.
- **Haptic feedback** and **Keypress sound**.

The keyboard's look — theme, colors, typeface, and bottom padding — moved to the **Look** page,
alongside the launcher's other visual choices; **Theme**, **Keyboard colors**, **Typeface** and
**Customize keyboard appearance** are greyed out here while the on-screen keyboard is not the
built-in one. Keyboard height is remembered separately for portrait and landscape.

## Apps

- **What this app is for:** Launcher or Terminal only. Terminal only hides the pinned apps row,
  alphabets row, app drawer and widget pane, and keeps the app in Recents; every switch below stays
  editable, so you can bring any of them back.
- **Edit pinned apps**.
- **App drawer:** swipe down on the pinned row to open it; choose the drawer layout. **Open the
  keyboard with the drawer** brings the keyboard up as the drawer opens; **Search with the Android
  keyboard** searches through your Android keyboard, with its suggestions and swipe typing. With the
  categories layout, **Sort apps into categories** and **Re-run categorization** appear here too; the
  re-run row counts the apps installed since the last run, and the drawer mentions them once when
  more than five are waiting.
- **Widget pane:** keep a page of home-screen widgets beside the terminal.
- **Launcher haptics** and **Notification dots**.
- **Most-used apps page:** add a page ranked by launcher usage.
- **App search prefix:** character that starts app filtering at an idle shell prompt; `%` is the
  default.
- **Reset usage ranking:** clear learned rankings without changing pins.
- **Set as default launcher:** open Android's default Home app screen.
- **Play the tour again:** replay the first-launch overlay tour, card one onward, on the home
  screen behind Settings.
- **Double tap A–Z Row to lock screen:** choose and configure the available lock backend.

Where the pinned apps stand, the alphabets row, and the widget grid's size are all in the **Layout**
editor now, one place and orientation at a time, and its dock look is tuned in Appearance, opened
from the long-press menu on that place.

## Linux display

The Linux display has its own page: the **Display** switch runs a Linux desktop or X11 apps
as the third place of the home screen — see [The Linux display](X11_Display.md). Under it sit touch
mode, **Keyboard follows text fields** — the keyboard opens when you tap a text field on the
display and closes when you tap elsewhere, on by default and available in Touchscreen touch mode —
resolution, text size, clipboard sharing, whether Linux apps are listed in the app drawer,
**Get GUI apps** to install some — from Termux itself or from a full Linux inside it — and
**GUI apps** to choose which of them stay out of the drawer
(see [Linux apps from a distro](Linux_Apps_From_A_Distro.md)),
the window manager started with the display, the mark on the Display place's badge in the status
bar, starting the display with the launcher, the start command, pointing new shells at the
display, two compatibility switches, and what your GPU can do for Linux apps. Where the extra keys
stand while the display is showing, and everything else about its arrangement, lives in
**Settings → Layout → Display** once the switch above is on. To have the phone try every graphics
profile and keep the best, run `termux-x11-gpu-setup` in a shell.

## Services & permissions

This page reports real availability and offers the appropriate fix or manage action:

- **TAI · Termux AI:** local AI service, model catalog, runtime, endpoint, and token settings.
- **Shizuku:** optional privileged backend connection. See the [Shizuku guide](Shizuku.md) for
  setup, feature fallbacks, and troubleshooting.
- **Termux:API:** configuration appears when the matching add-on is installed.
