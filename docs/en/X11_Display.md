# The Linux display

The launcher can show a Linux desktop or any X11 app beside the terminal, as the **Display**
place of the pane wall — swipe left on the status bar from the terminal, or tap the screen glyph
in the status bar's right edge. The display server runs in your shell like any other command, so
everything you know from Termux:X11 (its flags, its preferences, `pkill termux-x11`) works the
same way. This page is the short route from switching it on to running a desktop in a proot.

## Turn it on

1. Swipe to the Display place and tap **Turn on**, or open **Settings → Display** and
   switch on **Display**. The Display place is always there; switching the display on puts
   the `termux-x11` and `termux-x11-preference` commands in your `$PREFIX/bin` so a display can
   be started from it.
2. Install the keyboard layouts the server needs:

   ```sh
   pkg install x11-repo
   pkg install xkeyboard-config
   ```

   On a pacman-based install the X11 repository is already configured, so `pacman -S
   xkeyboard-config` is all it takes; on the VAJ edition skip the first line, its repository has
   the package directly. Until the layouts are installed the Display place says so and the Start
   button is hidden.
3. Start a display from any shell:

   ```sh
   termux-x11 :0 &
   export DISPLAY=:0
   ```

   or tap **Start display** on the Display place, which runs the same command.
4. Run something: `pkg install xorg-xeyes && xeyes`. Swipe to the Display place to see it.

Switching the display off in Settings takes the two commands back out of `$PREFIX/bin`; the
Display place stays and offers to turn it on again. Running servers are not stopped.

If you already have the `termux-x11-nightly` package installed, the launcher leaves its
`termux-x11` alone and tells you so. That package can only talk to the separate Termux:X11 app;
`pkg uninstall termux-x11-nightly` and reopen the launcher to use the built-in display instead.

## Every day

- **Move between places** by swiping left or right anywhere on the status bar, or by tapping the
  place icons peeking in from its edges. Where the wall rests is where the home screen comes back
  to. **Go to Widgets**, **Go to Terminal** and **Go to Display** are actions like any other:
  put one on the extra-keys row from its editor, on the in-app keyboard as a `tool:wall.display`
  key, or bind it in your keybinds file — `map ctrl+alt+shift+d wall.display` — see
  [Customize keyboard bindings](Terminal_Modernization.md#customize-keyboard-bindings). Scripts
  keep `wall.go page=…`.
- **Typing.** The launcher's keyboard and its extra-keys row type into the display while it is
  showing, and a hardware keyboard is the display's entirely: every key and every chord goes to
  X, and the launcher's shortcuts and their hints stay out of the way. Leave the display by
  touch, by the place icons, or with Home.
- **One clipboard.** Copy in an app on the display and the text is on the phone's clipboard,
  ready to paste anywhere; copy anywhere on the phone and it is there for the display's apps.
  The keyboard's copy, cut, paste, select all, undo and redo keys do on the display what they do
  on a desktop, the paste key on the extra-keys row pastes into the display rather than behind
  it, and **Fn** with the paste key types the text out instead, for an app that has its own idea
  of what Ctrl+V means. The two sides share by default — Settings → **Display** → **Share the
  clipboard** is the way to keep them apart.
- **Switching apps.** The keyboard's window actions work on the display's apps: swipe the space
  bar from its top corners (**Next window** at the top right, **Previous window** at the top
  left) to step through the apps the status bar lists, in the same order as its chips. The same
  actions on the extra-keys row, a key chord or `launcherctl` do the same while the Display place
  is up.
- **The keyboard follows text fields.** In Touchscreen touch mode, tapping a text field on the
  display brings the keyboard up and tapping elsewhere puts it down — see
  [The keyboard follows text fields](#the-keyboard-follows-text-fields).
- **The keyboard floats.** In landscape the keyboard comes up over the display instead of
  squeezing it, so the picture keeps the size it was given and nothing on it moves as you type. In
  portrait the display makes room for the keyboard instead. Either orientation can be set the other
  way from **Settings → Layout → Display**, after switching to the orientation you want it for.
- **The controls.** Hold a corner of the display and its buttons drop out of it, as they do on a
  terminal pane: power starts, stops or turns on the display, and the cog opens its settings. A
  tap in the corner goes to the display, so a maximised window keeps its own controls there. Tap
  anywhere else to put them away.
- **Touch.** Settings → **Display** → **Touch** says what a finger on the display does.
  **Touchscreen** is the tablet: fingers are touches, so a page scrolls, pinches, drags and
  long-presses where you put them, and an app written for a touchscreen behaves as it would on
  one. Apps that only understand a mouse still get taps and drags as clicks. The keyboard follows
  text fields in this mode, and pinching zooms what is on the display rather than the picture of
  it — use the scale rail for that. **Trackpad** turns the whole display into a laptop touchpad
  for apps that want a pointer and nothing else. **Direct touch** sends the same touches as
  Touchscreen, without the launcher's keyboard and pinch behaviour on top. Apps started from the
  drawer are told to take touch, so Firefox needs no setup.
- **Mouse mode.** The **Mouse mode** action — put it on the extra-keys row, the in-app keyboard
  as a `tool:mouse.toggle` key, or a chord — swaps the keyboard for a touchpad of the same size
  while the display is showing. Over a split keyboard the parting widens instead and the touchpad
  stands in it, so both halves keep typing. Its gestures are a laptop's: a finger moves the pointer and a tap
  clicks; hold, or tap and touch again, then move, to drag. Two fingers scroll, keep going after a
  fast lift, and pinch to zoom; two fingers tapping together click the right button. Three fingers
  tapping click the middle button, swiping left or right switch windows, and swiping down bring
  the keyboard back. The arrow in the corner does the same. A strip down the pad's trailing edge
  scrolls with one thumb alone — no second finger needed — and coasts on after a flick the same
  way the two-finger scroll does. The keyboard is never far while the touchpad is up: tap a text
  field on the display and it comes to the front, and the touchpad is back the moment the field
  lets go. The keyboard key brings it forward by hand, and the mouse key sends it away again
  without leaving mouse mode. In the terminal the same action makes every touch the mouse
  for programs that take one: a finger is the left button, two fingers are the wheel, and a fast
  lift keeps it turning. A program that has not asked for the mouse gets nothing typed at it;
  two fingers scroll the transcript there instead. A small mouse at the end of the status bar
  says the mode is on; tap it, or the action again, to switch it off.
- **Back** puts the keyboard down when the display was the one that raised it — for a text field,
  or in front of mouse mode's touchpad. With no such keyboard up it goes back inside the app on
  the display instead, the way the button does everywhere else on the phone. A keyboard you opened
  yourself stays where it is.
- **Stop** from the long-press menu on the display. Every app on it is asked to close itself first,
  the way it would when you close its window, and the display goes once they have. `pkill
  termux-x11` stops it outright instead, without giving apps that chance. The display never starts
  on its own unless you turn on **Start with the launcher**.
- **The display survives switching away.** Your X apps keep running while you are on the
  terminal or the widget grid; only the picture is put away.
- **Options.** Settings → **Display** holds the switch, touch mode, resolution,
  text size, clipboard sharing and how the launcher starts a display: with the launcher, with a
  command of your choosing, pointing new shells at it (`DISPLAY` set in every new shell while a
  display runs), and two compatibility switches. A running display picks a change up at once.
  Where the extra keys stand while the display is showing — along the bottom or in a column on
  the left or right edge — is in **Settings → Layout → Display**.
- **Preferences from a shell.** `termux-x11-preference list` shows every setting;
  `termux-x11-preference touchMode:2` sets one, exactly as in Termux:X11, and the running
  display follows.
- **Server flags.** `termux-x11 :0 -ac -dpi 240 -legacy-drawing -force-bgra -xstartup "xfce4-session"`
  — all Xorg flags and Termux:X11's own are accepted. `-legacy-drawing` is the one to try if the
  picture stays black on an unusual GPU.

## The keyboard follows text fields

Tap a text field on the display and the keyboard comes up; tap anywhere else and it goes away
again. It is on by default — Settings → **Display** → **Keyboard follows text fields** — and it
only applies in **Touchscreen** touch mode, where a tap lands where you put it. Trackpad and
Direct touch are unchanged.

A keyboard you opened yourself is yours: it stays until you close it, and taps on the desktop
never take it away. Only a keyboard that came up for a text field is put away for one.

With mouse mode on, the keyboard and the touchpad share one frame, so the field brings the keyboard
to the front of it and the touchpad waits behind rather than going away. Tap somewhere that is not
text, or press the mouse key, and the touchpad is back where it was. A tap on the touchpad counts as
a tap on whatever the pointer is standing on, so this works in every touch mode while the touchpad
is up.

Two signals tell the launcher that a text field is under your finger.

**The pointer's shape.** Nothing to set up. X tells the launcher nothing about focus, but the
window under the pointer names the cursor it wants — `xterm` over text, `left_ptr` over most other
things — and the display server passes that name on. Only the name seen in the moment after a tap
counts, so a pointer crossing a text field on its way somewhere else opens nothing. An app that
never asks for a text cursor, or a session with no cursor theme installed, cannot be recognised
this way; the keyboard key, the display's Back button and the signal below all still work.
GTK and Qt apps pick up the Adwaita theme that ships with them; core X apps such as xterm only
use it with `XCURSOR_THEME=Adwaita` in their environment (or a `default` cursor theme that
inherits it).

**Your input method's own focus.** Exact, and opt in. Two commands feed the same behaviour from a
shell, so anything that knows when a field takes focus can drive it:

```sh
launcherctl keyboard show --source focus
launcherctl keyboard hide --source focus
```

They are read as a signal, not an order: on the display they go through the same rules as a tap,
and elsewhere they simply open or close the keyboard. `--source manual` (the default) is you
asking, which pins the keyboard until you put it down again.

With fcitx5, tell your toolkits to use it and run a small watcher beside your session:

```sh
pkg install fcitx5
export GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
export QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
export XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
```

```sh
# focus-keyboard.sh — run it in the background: sh focus-keyboard.sh &
dbus-monitor --session "type='method_call',interface='org.fcitx.Fcitx.InputContext1'" |
while read -r line; do
    case "$line" in
        *FocusIn*)  launcherctl keyboard show --source focus ;;
        *FocusOut*) launcherctl keyboard hide --source focus ;;
    esac
done
```

This recipe is documented, not device-verified: it needs a session D-Bus running in the same
session as fcitx5, and the interface name is fcitx5's own. If nothing happens, check that
`dbus-monitor` prints anything at all while you move between fields.

## GPU acceleration for your apps

The display server itself always draws in software: X apps render into their own buffers and hand
the finished pixels to the server. What can be accelerated is the *client* side — a game, a
browser, a compositor — through one of the profiles below. Pick the first one that matches your
phone, install its packages, and export its variables in the shell that starts the app (or in
the proot's login shell). The launcher never sets these for you.

| Profile | Packages | Export before starting the app | Also run | For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turnip-zink` | `mesa`, `mesa-vulkan-icd-freedreno` (the Vulkan loader comes with mesa) | `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink TU_DEBUG=noconform` (add `VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$PREFIX/share/vulkan/icd.d/freedreno_icd.aarch64.json` if several ICDs are installed) | nothing | Qualcomm Adreno phones (`/dev/kgsl-3d0` exists) |
| `virgl` | `virglrenderer-android`, `mesa` | `GALLIUM_DRIVER=virpipe MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.3COMPAT MESA_GLES_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2 MESA_NO_ERROR=1 LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1` | `virgl_test_server_android &` | most phones with a working Android GL driver; Mali is often unreliable |
| `virgl-angle` | as `virgl`, plus `angle-android` | as `virgl` | `virgl_test_server_android --angle-gl &` | Mali, Xclipse and PowerVR phones where plain `virgl` misbehaves |
| `vulkan-wrapper` | `vulkan-wrapper-android`, `mesa` | `VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$PREFIX/share/vulkan/icd.d/wrapper_icd.aarch64.json MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink` (Mali: add `MESA_VK_WSI_PRESENT_MODE=mailbox MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=blit`) | nothing | non-Adreno phones with a Vulkan driver |
| `software` | `mesa` | `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=llvmpipe` | nothing | everything; the floor |

The launcher can pick for you: `launcherctl x11 gpu` says which row fits this phone and what is
installed, and `launcherctl x11 gpu --env` prints the exports to paste or `eval`. The same
answer is at the bottom of the Display page in Settings.

Or let the phone decide by trying: `termux-x11-gpu-setup` installs the drivers for every row that
fits this phone, runs a short 3D test with each on a private display, keeps the one that really
uses the GPU and is clearly faster than software, and removes the rest again. It explains each
step as it goes, asks before installing anything, and writes what it decided to
`~/.config/termux-launcher/x11-gpu.env`. With a Debian proot installed it repeats the test inside
the container. `--keep` leaves every package in place, `--skip-proot` skips the container,
`--yes` skips the question.

Check what you got with `glmark2-es2` (from `x11-repo`): its first lines name the renderer, and
the score with the Display place *showing* is the one that means anything — hidden, the server has
no surface and the number is meaningless.

Mesa 26 picks its own path unless all three of `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE`, `GALLIUM_DRIVER` and
`MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE` agree, so set every variable a row lists, not just one.

## Apps on the display

With the display switched on, the Linux apps installed in your prefix appear in the app drawer
beside your Android apps, with their own icons. Tapping one starts the display if it is not
running, opens the app on it full size, and takes you to the Display place — nothing to type.
They can be pinned and searched like any other app. `pkg install firefox`, and Firefox is in the
drawer the next time you return to the launcher.

Apps installed inside a distro are listed the same way, under **Linux Apps** in the drawer, and
the launcher can set a distro up for you — see [Linux apps from a distro](Linux_Apps_From_A_Distro.md).
An app whose menu entry asks for a terminal opens in a terminal pane rather than on the display.

Two things make this work and can be changed on the Display page in Settings:

- **Window manager.** The launcher starts a small window manager with the display so windows
  open full size and dialogs stay on screen. It is `openbox` by default (install it with
  `pkg install openbox`), with a launcher-owned rule that maximises every window; put another
  command there, or clear it to have none. Windows fill the display to its rounded corners, as on
  any rounded desktop, so a terminal that wants its first and last cells clear of the arcs pads
  its own window (`window_padding_width` in kitty, `window.padding` in alacritty).
- **Linux apps in the drawer** can be switched off if you would rather start apps from a shell.

When an app is started from the drawer, the launcher exports the GPU settings from the table
below for whichever profile's packages are installed, so a GPU app is accelerated without any
setup. The first time the display is turned on, the text size and touch mode are set to values
that suit a phone; both can be changed afterwards.

## A desktop in a proot

The display server's socket lives in the launcher's `$TMPDIR`, so a proot needs to share it:

```sh
pkg install proot-distro
proot-distro install archlinux
termux-x11 :0 &
proot-distro login archlinux --shared-x11 -e DISPLAY=:0
```

`--shared-x11` hands the container the socket directory and nothing else; `--shared-tmp` shares
the whole temporary directory and works too. Neither is on by default. `DISPLAY` has to be passed
in with `-e` — exporting it in your Termux shell does not carry it across. The server needs no
`-ac` and the container needs no `xauth`.

Inside, install and start any X11 desktop or app as usual (`pacman -S xfce4 && startxfce4`, or a
single app). A single app needs none of this from the drawer's point of view: apps installed in a
container are listed in the app drawer by themselves, and a tap opens one here — see
[Linux apps from a distro](Linux_Apps_From_A_Distro.md).

GPU profiles work inside the proot too: install the *distro's* Mesa, export the same
variables in the proot shell, and — for the `virgl` profiles — keep `virgl_test_server_android`
running in Termux and export `VTEST_SOCKET_NAME=/tmp/.virgl_test` inside the proot.

### Phosh

Phosh's compositor, `phoc`, can run on the display as an X11 client:

```sh
export WLR_BACKEND=x11 WLR_X11_OUTPUTS=1 WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1
WLR_RENDERER=pixman phoc          # works everywhere, software rendering
```

The GPU path (`WLR_RENDERER=vulkan` on an Adreno phone) needs a Mesa built for the Android
kernel driver (`-Dfreedreno-kmds=kgsl`) and the wlroots patches from
[phosh-termux-gpu](https://github.com/Azkali/phosh-termux-gpu), which copies each frame out of
Vulkan into the display over shared memory. Stock distro packages fail with "no DRM FD
available" — the display has no DRI3 to offer — and their Turnip sees only llvmpipe. Keep apps on
`GSK_RENDERER=cairo`.

Checked on a Nothing Phone 2: `phoc` from a Debian trixie proot (`proot-distro install
debian:trixie`, then `apt install phoc`) comes up on the display with the pixman renderer,
unpatched. Newer `proot-distro` builds name images Docker-style (`debian:trixie`, `ubuntu:24.04`);
the container is then just `debian`.

## When something is off

- **"No display is running" although you started one.** The server exits before it opens a port
  when the keyboard layouts are missing — install `xkeyboard-config`. Run `termux-x11 :0` in the
  foreground to read its message.
- **Apps say they cannot open the display, though the server is running.** X programs look for
  the display's socket in `$PREFIX/tmp`. If your shell sets `TMPDIR` somewhere else, a server
  started from that shell puts its socket there and no program finds it; start the server with
  `TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp termux-x11 :0`, or leave `TMPDIR` alone. A socket left behind by a server
  that has exited causes the same symptom — remove it from `$PREFIX/tmp/.X11-unix/`.
- **`termux-x11-gpu-setup` says even software rendering did not finish.** The test could not talk
  to a display at all; the two causes above are the usual ones, and the full log it names shows
  the test program's own message.
- **A profile's package is "not available here".** Not every package source carries every driver
  — pacman's repositories have no `vulkan-wrapper-android`, for instance. The script skips that
  profile and tries the rest.
- **A black display.** Start the server with `-legacy-drawing`; if that helps, keep it in the
  start command.
- **Apps cannot open the display from a proot.** Log in with `--shared-x11`, and check
  `echo $DISPLAY` inside.
- **Nothing is accelerated.** `glmark2-es2` names the renderer in its first lines — `llvmpipe`
  means a profile variable is missing or the profile does not fit this GPU.

On the VAJ edition the display works the same way, but there is no separate `x11-repo`: its own
repository carries what the display needs directly, so it is `pkg install xkeyboard-config` alone,
and `pkg install openbox` for the window manager. The same repository carries a small set of
graphical apps (a file manager, a text editor, a terminal) but no browser yet.
