 * terminal twice just to type three letters into its search box. This plane is a view inside the
 * activity, exactly like {@link TerminalCommandPaletteController} and the rename chip: focus never
 * moves, nothing here is an {@code EditText}, and typing arrives through the same three channels a
 * focusless overlay has to serve — the in-app keyboard's interceptor, hardware key events, and text
 * a system IME commits.

 * <p>Sheets stack rather than replace: the workspace picker opens a delete confirmation on top of
