/**
 * Where a floating keyboard is and how wide it is, as arithmetic.
 *
 * <p>Two numbers describe the frame. Its width is a share of the room it is floating in, so the
 * same setting reads the same on a phone and on a tablet. Its place is a pair of fractions of the
 * <em>travel</em> — the room left over once the frame is taken out of the content, {@code 0} against
 * the left or top edge and {@code 1} against the right or bottom one. A fraction rather than a pixel
 * is what lets the memory survive a rotation, a font-scale change and a keyboard the user has since
 * made taller: the frame comes back the same distance along a different amount of room.
 *
 * <p>Travel can be zero — a full-width frame has nowhere to go sideways — and every conversion here
 * has to answer for that rather than divide by it. Pure, so the answers can be read and tested
 * without a window; {@link FloatingKeyboardFrame} only applies them.
