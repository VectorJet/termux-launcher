/**
 * The card a floating keyboard rides in: a grab handle along the top and the keyboard host under
 * it, parked wherever the user last left it.
 *
 * <p>The frame is deliberately thin. It carries no idea of what a keyboard is — the keyboard's own
 * container is moved into {@link #contentHost()} unchanged, keeps its glass, its suggestion strip
 * and its height controls, and is measured by the normal layout pass against the width this frame
 * was given. What the frame owns is the handle and the drag: it clamps the offset it is dragged to
 * against the travel it was handed and reports where it ended up, so the arithmetic stays in
 * {@link FloatingKeyboardGeometry} and the memory stays in the store. The bottom-leading corner is
 * the other half of that: a grip the card is resized from, which scales its width and the
 * keyboard's row height at once and reports both the same way. Out from that corner is bigger —
 * left widens the card, up makes its rows taller — so the two edges the finger is not on, the
 * right one and the bottom one, are the ones that stay put.</p>
 *
 * <p>The card is moved from its two top corners, as every frame on the wall is moved and resized
 * from its corners, and from the pill drawn between them — an affordance that is drawn has to
 * answer where it is drawn. The rest of the handle row is only the gap above the keys.</p>
 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code floating_keyboard_host}, which covers the whole content region. That is
 * what makes a keyboard parked halfway up the screen touchable: a view translated outside its
 * parent's bounds still draws, but never receives a touch.</p>
