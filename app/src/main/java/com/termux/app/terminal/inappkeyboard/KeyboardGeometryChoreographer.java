/**
 * The in-app keyboard's geometry and its flash-free reveal choreography.
 *
 * <p>Showing the embedded keyboard is not one state change but an ordered protocol. Its height has
 * to be measured against a stable root (never against the accessory stack it is about to resize, or
 * the two {@code AT_MOST} passes chase each other), the destination glass crop has to be installed
 * before any key is allowed to draw, and on the way out the conservative close cover has to survive
 * exactly until dock-only layout is observed. Those steps used to be ten methods and eleven
 * correlated flags spread over four thousand lines of {@code TermuxActivity}, where nothing said
 * which of them had to happen first.</p>
 *
 * <p>They are one mechanism, so they live in one module. Callers state <em>what happened</em> —
 * {@link #onVisibilityRequested(boolean)}, {@link #completePendingOpenReveal(ChromeSpec)},
 * {@link #onImeVisibilityProbed(boolean)} — and the module owns the ordering. Everything it needs
 * from the Activity goes through {@link Surface}, which is what makes the ordering assertable
 * without a window: the reveal cannot be observed as "keys visible before crop installed" on a fake
 * any more than it can on a device.</p>
 *
 * <p>The chrome <em>painters</em> deliberately stay on the Activity (they are welded to the glass
 * factory, the backdrop bitmaps and the dock layout) and are invoked through {@link Surface}. What
 * lives here is the protocol: the pending-reveal and pending-close flags, the two pre-draw gates,
 * the blocked-frame fail-safe, the deferral predicate and the measurement cache.</p>
