/**
 * What a window chip is drawn in, once the band under it has been measured.
 *
 * <p>The window chips — the row's pills in {@link TerminalWindowBar} and the column's squares in
 * {@code StatusBarWindowColumn} — were dressed in alphas tuned against a dark bar: a fill at
 * {@code 16/255} of {@code termux_secondary}, a stroke at {@code 34}, a label at {@code 148}. Over
 * the light-mode glass the user reported ({@code #6A5755}) every one of those composites to within
 * one percent of the band itself — the measured label ratio was 1.03:1, which is why the chip
 * labelled {@code herdr} was simply not there. This is the arithmetic that replaces those numbers
 * with colours derived from what the band turned out to be.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Which tier each piece is held to</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The label</b> — {@link OnGlass#TARGET_BODY_TEXT}. It is body-sized text, selected or
 *       not; a resting chip is quieter than the current one because its ink starts muted and
 *       stops as soon as it clears, not because it is allowed to be illegible.</li>
 *   <li><b>The outline</b> — {@link OnGlass#TARGET_LARGE_TEXT}, the WCAG floor for meaningful
 *       graphics. The outline is what makes a chip a chip: it is the only thing that says where
 *       one window ends and the next begins, and on the reporting device it was the one part of
 *       the chip that survived at all. The same tier holds the marks that ride it — the busy
 *       ring, the bell, the tick — since each of them is the only carrier of its own fact.</li>
 *   <li><b>The fills</b> — deliberately <em>no</em> floor, not even
 *       {@link OnGlass#TARGET_DECORATION}. This is arithmetic, not taste: a fill that clears 2.0
 *       against a band at 10.5% luminance lands the chip's surface at roughly 26% luminance, and
 *       no ink at all clears 4.5 against that — a pale one would need a luminance above 1.0 and a
 *       dark one would have to be darker than the band the chrome already decided was too dark for
 *       dark ink. Giving the wash a floor would take the label's away. So a fill is a wash whose
 *       only duty is to not cost the label its tier, which is enforced by measuring the label on
 *       the surface the fill actually produces rather than on the bare band.</li>
 *   <li><b>The watermark glyph</b> — the same, and for the same reason. It is measured <em>into</em>
 *       the label's ground instead of being given a floor of its own.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Why the ink moves in one direction</h3>
 * <p>{@link OnGlass#inkOn(int, int, double)} finds the <em>nearest</em> qualifying tone, either
 * side of the surface, which is right for a lone ink and wrong here: {@link
 * com.termux.app.chrome.ChromeInk} has already decided one polarity for the whole chrome, and a
 * chip whose outline went pale while its label went dark would break that on its own. Every ink
 * here therefore walks its own HCT tone axis in the polarity's direction only, through
 * {@link SchemeTone#toneShift}, and stops at the first tone that clears. Hue and chroma survive,
 * so the place's accent is still the place's accent.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure, static and context free, so all of it unit tests on the JVM.</p>
