/**
 * Where the surface editor's pill parks, and how many rows it can afford there.
 *
 * <p>The card sits next to the surface it edits, never on top of it: the standoff from its surface is constant, so the pill rides the dock's lift and the
 * keyboard's reveal instead of being placed against whatever else is on screen. Everything else
 * falls out of clamping that one offset inside the terminal region — a keyboard whose only free
 * neighbour is occupied by the dock pushes the pill above the dock without anybody deciding that
 * case, and a surface with no room on its own side ends up on the other one.
 *
 * <p>The card gives way with the room. A system IME on a cramped phone can collapse the band
 * between the anchors below anything the card's whole list needs (issue #20), and the answer is a
 * shorter card rather than a clipped one or one pinned over the surfaces bounding it. What gives is
 * the scrolling body ({@link #bodyCapPx}), which has a floor, so a region too short for anything
 * still leaves a strip of list. The chooser row above it does not shrink — it unpins and scrolls
 * with the body instead, which is
 * {@link com.termux.app.editorshell.EditorShellMetrics#chooserPinned}'s business.
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic on pixels, no views, so the cases that matter — keyboard up, keyboard down, a
 * top-anchored surface, a squeezed screen — are testable without inflating the editor.
