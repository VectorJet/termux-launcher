/**
 * What the surface editor may offer for the arrangement that is actually on screen.
 *
 * <p>The editor used to be written for one arrangement: a status bar along the top, a dock along
 * the bottom, and the free room in between. Every place can now stand its bar on any of the four
 * edges and put its apps and its extra keys in a column, and two things went wrong with that.
 *
 * <p>The band the card and the resting pill park in was measured from the bar wherever it stood: a
 * bar along the bottom put the band's ceiling underneath its floor, and a bar standing in a column
 * put it at the foot of the display, so the band collapsed to nothing and everything the editor
 * draws was parked off the bottom of the screen — the editor was open and there was nothing to see.
 * {@link #freeBandPx} is that band, derived from the edge the bar stands on rather than from the
 * bar's rect alone, and it always leaves a usable strip: a card overhanging its band by a few dp is
 * still a card, one measured to zero is not.
 *
 * <p>And the offer itself has to match the arrangement. A surface that is not on screen has no
 * card, and a row that describes a shape the surface does not have — pages of apps for a rail that
 * scrolls — is not offered rather than offered dead.
 *
 * <p>Pure: an arrangement and a few pixel counts in, booleans and pixel counts out, so every case
 * is testable without a window.
