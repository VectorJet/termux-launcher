 * The run, as data: five lessons, two questions and the closing card.

 * <p>The lessons teach the five things a newcomer cannot look up without them — where help is, how
 * to put their own apps in the dock, how to reach the rest of their Android apps, how to get the
 * keyboard out of the way, and how to find an action.
 * Everything else is offered on the way out or lives in help, and nothing here opens a shell, a
 * window or a session: the user's first terminal is exactly as they left it.
 *
 * <p>Two lessons read the phone rather than a fixed sentence, which is what {@link RunContext} is:
 * "press Home to come back" is wrong on a phone whose home screen is something else, and "hide the
 * keyboard" is wrong when the keyboard is already down.
