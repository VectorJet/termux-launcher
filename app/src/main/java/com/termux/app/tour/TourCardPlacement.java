/**
 * Where the card sits for the control it is about, as pure arithmetic.
 *
 * <p>A card floating in the middle of the screen makes the user find the glow for themselves. This
 * puts it against its target — centred on it, on the side of it with room — and hands back the
 * pointer's tip so the two read as one object.
 *
 * <p>The overlay is the whole window, so its two ends are not interchangeable: the top of it is
 * behind the system status bar and the bottom behind the gesture bar, which is why the vertical
 * keep-out is two numbers rather than one. It is also what makes the flip below do anything — with
 * equal ends, a side that cannot hold the card is always the side the target is furthest from.
 *
 * <p>All of it is integers in overlay pixels and none of it touches a view, so every case below —
 * a target at the top, at the bottom, against either edge, too tall to sit on its own side, absent
 * altogether — is a unit test rather than a phone.
