/**
 * What the first-run permissions card offers, and whether it is offered at all.
 *
 * <p>The three things the launcher wants on the way in — the wallpaper read, the weather's rough
 * location, the Linux display — used to be three dialogs in a row, each raised from the last one's
 * result, so a fresh install opened on a stack of system prompts before the user had seen the
 * launcher at all. They are one card now, the way an established app asks: a row per item, each
 * with what it is for and a control, and one Continue.
 *
 * <p>Pure, so the whole decision table below — granted, denied or never asked, on a fresh install
 * or an update — is a unit test rather than a run through the installer.
