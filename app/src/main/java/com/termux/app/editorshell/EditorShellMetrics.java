/**
 * Every size the Appearance and Layout editors are built from, in one place.
 *
 * <p>The two editors used to inherit their widths from the card, and the card from the screen, so a
 * landscape screen gave a 0–40 dp corner slider nearly 900 dp of travel and a portrait one gave the
 * same control a tenth of that. The rule here runs the other way: the control kit declares its
 * widths, the row is the sum of its columns, the pane is the row, and the card is the panes. What
 * is left over on a wide screen becomes air around the card — which is the live place the editor is
 * for — rather than stretched controls.
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic on dp, pixels and counts. No views, no {@code Context}, no resources, so every
 * case the two reference devices raise is assertable without inflating an editor.
