/**
 * Where a corner tab goes, and what shape it is. Every frame on the wall answers a corner tap with
 * the same small tab of buttons — the Widgets page, the Display page and a terminal pane — and this
 * is the one place that decides where it lands, so all three agree to the pixel and none of them
 * can drift out of its own frame again.
 *
 * <p>The rule, in one paragraph. A frame's border is a stroke of its own width painted just inside
 * its bounding box, and it is that stroke's <em>inner</em> edge — the visible line the eye reads as
 * the frame — the tab lines up against, never the bounding box. The tab is laid out inside
 * {@code bounds} shrunk by {@code borderStrokePx} on all four sides, and it sits <em>flush</em> in
 * the corner it came out of: its outer edge is the frame's own side, and its outer corner is the
 * frame's own corner, arc and all. So the frame's stroke is the tab's outer outline — there is one
 * line there, not two — and the only boundary the tab draws for itself is the one it shares with
 * the pane's interior ({@link #tabPathPoints}). It grows towards the middle and slides out of the
 * edge its corner is on — down from a top corner, up from a bottom one — so at
 * {@code progress == 0} it is entirely outside the frame and at {@code progress == 1} entirely
 * inside it. It never crosses the far side: a frame too narrow for the buttons at the size they
 * asked for gets a tab that stops {@code edgeMarginPx} short of that edge, with the buttons sharing
 * the room left in proportion rather than walking off the end. Nothing this returns ever lies
 * outside {@code bounds} horizontally.
 *
 * <p>Pure geometry in the caller's own coordinate space: hand it pane-local bounds and the rects
 * come back pane-local; hand it host coordinates and they come back in host coordinates. Nothing
 * here knows what a view is, and no caller may mix the two.
