/**
 * The one way a launcher colour is made legible on glass, and the one way a glyph gets its halo.
 *
 * <p>{@link OnGlass} answers for a <em>band</em> — what veil it needs and what ink stands on it.
 * This answers the question the launcher's own painted things have: the A&ndash;Z letters, the
 * drawer's A&ndash;Z rope, the gesture orb, the edge bloom, the page ticks and the app-launch
 * ripple are not bands; they are colours drawn <em>on</em> a band that something else measured.
 * Before this class each of them clamped its own brightness up with an HSV floor — {@code
 * hsv[2] = max(0.78f, ...)} and four variations of it — which is the right direction on a dark
 * backdrop and exactly the wrong one on a light one. That is why the light mode's A&ndash;Z letters
 * measured 1.21:1 on the reporting device. There is one contrast call here instead, and every one
 * of those sites goes through it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The halo</h3>
 * <p>Both A&ndash;Z rails draw every glyph twice: a stroke pass under a fill pass. The stroke was a
 * fixed near-black ({@code #1A1F2A}) at alpha 195 whatever the mode, so in dark mode it melted into
 * the background and read as a clean letter, and in light mode it became the highest-contrast thing
 * on the strip — a hard dark ring around a letter that barely read against the band. An outlined
 * shape filled with something close to its own background is what the eye calls blurry, and that is
 * the user's "the alphabets row looks fuzzy": the halo, not the glyph.</p>
 *
 * <p>The double-draw stays; it is what keeps a glyph readable where the wallpaper changes under it
 * mid-letter. What changes is that the halo is no longer a constant:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It inverts with the glyph.</b> {@link #haloInk} takes the near-black under a pale glyph
 *       and a near-white under a dark one, decided from the glyph and the surface rather than from
 *       the mode, so it follows {@link ChromeInk}'s one polarity without asking it and without
 *       branching on the night theme.</li>
 *   <li><b>Its alpha is the smallest that does the job.</b> {@link #haloAlpha} spends the least
 *       alpha that deepens the glyph's edge by {@link #HALO_EDGE_GAIN} over what the bare band
 *       already gives it — a backdrop close to the glyph needs more, a backdrop far from it needs
 *       almost none — and never more than keeps the halo <em>quieter against the band than the
 *       glyph itself</em>. That ceiling is the anti-smear rule: whatever else happens, the shape the
 *       eye resolves first is the letter and not the ring around it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure, static and context free, so all of it unit tests on the JVM. Tone moves go through
 * {@link SchemeTone#contrastTone} — HCT, keeping hue and chroma — never ad-hoc HSV maths.</p>
