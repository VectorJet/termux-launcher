/**
 * Legibility arithmetic for chrome that draws on glass rather than on a card.
 *
 * <p>The launcher's chrome bands — the status strip, the window bar, the A&ndash;Z scrub rail, the
 * dock — are translucent panes over the wallpaper. Their foreground colours come from the Material
 * role palette, which is authored against an opaque surface: {@code termux_primary} is
 * {@code #345CA8} in {@code values/colors.xml} and {@code #B8C7FF} in {@code values-night}. Those
 * are on-white and on-black inks respectively, and a role colour is only ever checked against the
 * role surface it was authored for.</p>
 *
 * <p>That holds in dark mode by accident: Android dims the wallpaper for a dark theme, so the glass
 * lands near {@code #1B1A17} and a pale ink clears 4.5:1 comfortably. Nothing lightens the
 * wallpaper for a light theme, so in light mode the same glass measured 10.5% relative luminance on
 * the reporting device ({@code #6A5755} behind the status bar, {@code #657271} behind the A&ndash;Z
 * strip) while the ink stayed the dark-on-white {@code #345CA8} — 6.5:1 on a white card, 1.02:1
 * there. Measured on device: CPU label 1.03, RAM 1.10, weather ~1.0, separator dots 1.01, session
 * chip 1.75, window chip ~1.0, A&ndash;Z letter 1.21. Every one of those is under the 4.5:1 floor.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is the arithmetic half of the fix the user chose: <em>measure the backdrop and
 * adapt, veil only as far as needed</em>. Given what a band is actually drawn over, it answers how
 * much veil that band needs for the mode's own preferred ink to clear a target ratio, and what the
 * ink should become when even a capped veil is not enough. A dark wallpaper in light mode veils
 * barely at all; a bright one veils more; the answer follows the wallpaper instead of being frozen
 * into a resource. The sampling and caching half is {@link GlassBackdropCache}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure, static and context free, so all of it unit tests on the JVM. Tone moves go through
 * {@link SchemeTone#contrastTone} — HCT, keeping hue and chroma — never ad-hoc HSV maths.</p>

     *   <li>{@code preferredInk} already clears {@code target} on the bare backdrop — no veil,
     *       nothing changes. The wallpaper is untouched and this is the common case in dark mode.</li>
     *   <li>{@code alternateInk} clears it — no veil, the ink flips. This is the dark-wallpaper /
     *       light-mode case: the band is genuinely dark, so it takes the pale ink and the user keeps
     *       their wallpaper rather than a light slab over it. {@link Resolution#inkFlipped} is set.</li>
     *   <li>Neither reads: the least veil that gets the <em>preferred</em> ink to the target, capped
     *       at {@link #MAX_VEIL_ALPHA}. Veiling only ever moves toward the mode's own surface, so it
     *       only ever helps the mode's own ink — there is no point veiling for the alternate.</li>
     *   <li>The cap was not enough: the ink moves instead, {@link SchemeTone#contrastTone} on the
     *       capped surface, preferred hue first and the alternate's after it.</li>
     *   <li>Still short — a surface where no tone of either hue works: the more legible of black and
     *       white, with {@link Resolution#shortfall} set if even that misses.</li>
