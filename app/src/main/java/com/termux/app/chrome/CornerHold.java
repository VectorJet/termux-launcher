/**
 * The hold that takes a pane corner. A corner square is not a button: the program drawing in it —
 * tmux's clock, vim's ruler, a status line's last column — keeps every touch that does not rest
 * there, so a finger down in the square goes to the terminal first and the corner only claims it
 * once it has been still long enough to mean a hold.
 *
 * <p>Three ways out of that wait, and two of them give the gesture up for good: the finger travels
 * past the slop, a second finger lands, or it lifts. The chrome keeps handing the terminal every
 * event either way — it consumed the touch stream to be able to forward it — and simply claims
 * nothing.
 *
 * <p>Pure by design, like {@link com.termux.view.HoldTiming} on the other side of the same square:
 * the overlay feeds it a touch stream and reads back who owns the gesture and what the lift meant.
