/**
 * What each chrome band is actually drawn over, sampled once and kept until something moves.
 *
 * <p>{@link OnGlass} does the colour arithmetic but needs an input nothing in the tree produced
 * before: the real colour behind a band. This holds that. A caller hands it a {@link Sampler} that
 * can read the wallpaper — in practice a crop of the same pre-blurred frame
 * {@link WallpaperFrostPainter} already cuts for the glass bands, so the pixels are paid for once
 * for both jobs — plus the band's rect, the launcher's wallpaper dim and the band's own glass tint,
 * and gets back a composited backdrop or a whole {@link OnGlass.Resolution}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>When it recomputes</h3>
 * <p>Never per frame; chrome bands repaint constantly and a sample plus a veil search per draw
 * would be visible in a scroll. A band's sample is taken once and reused until one of these
 * happens:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #invalidate()} — the wallpaper changed, the palette changed, or the app moved
 *       between light and dark. The same events that clear {@link WallpaperBlurCache}.</li>
 *   <li>the band's rect changed — a rotation, an inset change, a bar that grew. Detected here by
 *       comparing the rect passed in, so callers need no extra bookkeeping.</li>
 *   <li>the dim, the tint, the ink, the veil colour or the target passed for that band changed —
 *       the memoised {@link OnGlass.Resolution} is keyed on all of them.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Before the first sample</h3>
 * <p>A band asking before any wallpaper is readable — first layout, passthrough mode with a live
 * wallpaper, a blur frame still being decoded on the worker — must not flash an unstyled colour and
 * must not crash. It gets {@link #setFallbackWallpaper the fallback wallpaper colour} instead,
 * which the caller sets to the mode's nominal glass: the answer is then exactly what the app did
 * before this round, and it is replaced by the measured answer as soon as a sample lands. Callers
 * can read {@link #hasSample} if they want to know which they got.</p>
 *
 * <p>Main thread only, like the rest of the chrome renderer; it holds no locks and does no I/O.</p>
