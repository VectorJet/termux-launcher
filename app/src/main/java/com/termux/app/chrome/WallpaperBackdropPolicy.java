/**
 * Who draws the wallpaper the glass is cut from — the system, or us.
 *
 * <p>The launcher window is translucent with {@code windowShowWallpaper}, so the ROM composites the
 * wallpaper behind it at a zoom we cannot read: on Nothing OS it measured 1.03 for one wallpaper
 * and 1.084 for another, it ignores {@code setWallpaperZoomOut}, and it moves with every wallpaper.
 * Every glass crop is cut from a frame this app captures itself, so the two pictures can only be
 * lined up by guessing that factor — which is what the Wallpaper alignment slider is.</p>
 *
 * <p>The way out is to stop guessing: when the wallpaper is a still image we can read, the launcher
 * draws it itself, from the very frame the crops come from. Backdrop and glass are then the same
 * pixels at the same offset, so alignment holds by construction on every ROM and the slider has
 * nothing left to correct — which is why {@link #renderZoomPercent} pins it to 100 there. A picture
 * we cannot be sure of (see {@link WallpaperPicture}) or a wallpaper we are not allowed to read
 * leaves the system drawing it, and the slider is the only tool that mode has.</p>
