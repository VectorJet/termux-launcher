/**
 * What stands on each edge of a place, in what order, how thick it is, and how much of the screen
 * the content beside it gives up. Pure and view-free — the relationship {@code DockLayoutPolicy}
 * has with the dock — so the real screen and the Layout page's miniature can read one answer
 * instead of each spelling the arrangement out again.
 *
 * <p>An edge is a stack: {@link #stack} lists what is on it outermost first, and an edge's content
 * inset is simply the sum of those bands' thicknesses. That replaced the hand-written {@code max()}
 * chain in {@code TermuxActivity.applyTerminalOverlayInsets}, where each column carried the whole
 * reach of every column outside it and the widest won. One {@link EdgeStackView} per edge is what
 * draws the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>One deliberate difference from the shipped chain.</b> A status bar standing in a column on
 * the same edge as the apps rail or the extra keys used not to stand <em>beside</em> them: the two
 * shared one column, the bar taking the top half of it, so the edge cost the wider of the two
 * rather than both. They stack like everything else now and the edge costs both. That merge is
 * what the Layout-freedom work replaced with an order the user can set; every other arrangement
 * the old model could express comes out byte-for-byte the same.
 *
 * <p>One rule is kept from the old model and is not ours to change: the status bar is never hidden,
 * because the wall's pager rides it. The other — the alphabets index following the pinned apps row
 * about — is gone: the index rides that row only while the two of them hold the same edge
 * ({@link PlaceChromePolicy#azRidesAppsRow}), so every element here draws on the edge its own slot
 * names and a row moved on its own leaves the index where it stood.
 *
 * <p>One rule is a renderer fact rather than a policy one, recorded here so the next reader does
 * not look for it: only a status bar standing on {@link Edge#TOP} gets the system-bar glass strip
 * behind it ({@code applyTerminalWindowBarBackdropInsets}). Nothing in this class decides that.
