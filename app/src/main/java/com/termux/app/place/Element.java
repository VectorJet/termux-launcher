     *       {@code EdgeStackView} holds {@code terminal_window_bar_host} and
     *       {@code place_az_bar_host} in.</li>
     *   <li><b>Bottom:</b> the extra keys, the alphabets row, the pinned apps, then the status
     *       bar. That was the {@code layout_above} chain {@code activity_termux.xml} drew before
     *       the dock's rows stood in {@code accessory_row_stack}; a bottom status bar stands in
     *       the bottom {@code EdgeStackView}, which is above the whole dock.</li>
     *   <li><b>Left and right:</b> the status bar, the apps rail, the extra keys column, then the
     *       alphabets bar. A column's lead-in says which: the status column starts at the cutout
     *       (the stack's own cutout padding), then the rail, the extra keys and the alphabets bar
     *       as the next three bands of that stack.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The two side stacks were the one place the shipped launcher did not really stack: a
     * status column and a rail on the same edge shared one column lengthwise instead of standing
     * beside each other. They stack now, which is the change the Layout-freedom work was for; see
     * {@link EdgeStackPolicy#contentInsets}.
