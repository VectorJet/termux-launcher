/**
 * The one host every movable bar stands in: a stack on a screen edge, holding its bars in the order
 * {@link EdgeStackPolicy#stack} gives them. Four of these — one per edge — are all the chrome hosts
 * the launcher has; a bar is a single view that gets re-parented from one stack to another rather
 * than a host per place it might go.
 *
 * <p>The edge decides the axis: a stack on a side runs across the screen, so its bars stand beside
 * one another and it is a horizontal row of columns; a stack on the top or the bottom runs down, so
 * its bars lie on one another and it is a vertical column of rows.
 *
 * <p>{@link #setStack} is given the bars <em>outermost first</em>, the way the policy counts them —
 * 0 is the band against the glass. On the top and the left edges that is also the first child, but
 * on the bottom and the right the outermost band is the <em>last</em> one a {@link LinearLayout}
 * lays out, so the order is reversed on the way in. Callers never have to know which.
 *
 * <p>A stack holds nothing but bands: every bar in it is a plain band of its own thickness, and the
 * edge's whole reach is the display cutout — kept once by the padded content root every stack now
 * stands inside — plus those bands, which is exactly what {@link EdgeStackPolicy#contentInsets}
 * answers.
 *
 * <p>A stack that is one sheet of glass also draws the hairlines between its bands
 * ({@link #setSeparatorCount}), over the boundaries it laid its children out on rather than as
 * bands of their own, so a separator costs the stack no height.
