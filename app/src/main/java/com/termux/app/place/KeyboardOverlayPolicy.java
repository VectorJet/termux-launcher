/**
 * When an open keyboard floats over the place instead of shrinking it, and what that does to the
 * geometry underneath.
 *
 * <p>Two places are floated over. The Linux display draws a screen of its own, at a size the guest
 * chose, and has nothing to reflow — taking room away from it scales the whole picture rather than
 * giving the keyboard somewhere to go; it is the one place where this is a choice. The home place
 * is a fixed field of cells, and every widget in it is laid out against that field: a keyboard that
 * took room from it would move and re-cut every widget on the way in and again on the way out, so
 * it always floats there, whatever is stored. Everywhere else the content is text that wants the
 * room, so the keyboard takes it, and a stored overlay is ignored rather than obeyed.
 *
 * <p>A floating keyboard is the exception on every place, the terminal included: it is a frame the
 * user has moved somewhere of their own choosing, so it is over the content by definition and
 * there is no arrangement in which it takes room from it.
 *
 * <p>Pure, so the answer can be read and tested without a window: the view layer only applies it.
