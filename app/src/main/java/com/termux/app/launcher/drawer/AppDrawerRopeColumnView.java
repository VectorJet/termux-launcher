/**
 * The drawer's A-Z rope: a strip of letters down the plane's right edge that hangs off the
 * transition and scrubs the grid.
 *
 * <p><b>It owns no time source.</b> {@link #advance} is called from
 * {@link AppDrawerContentView#advanceDrawerFx}, which is called from the drawer controller's one
 * {@link android.view.Choreographer} loop, so the growing plane and the letters inside it are
 * rendered on the same frame. A loop of its own would render them a frame apart, which on the
 * opening drag is a visible seam between the panel edge and the letters standing off it.
 *
 * <p><b>The stream is claimed at {@code ACTION_DOWN} and never re-decided.</b> A scrub cannot be
 * told apart from the plane's close drag by motion — it is a sustained downward drag in the same
 * place at the same speed — so a touch that lands on the strip is a scrub for its whole life. That
 * is also why only Y is read after the down: X is spent by
 * {@link AppDrawerTouchRegions#resolve} deciding the stream belongs here, and a finger that then
 * drifts left onto the grid keeps scrubbing rather than dropping out. A tap is simply a scrub that
 * lasted 80ms; there is no timeout and no tap slop.
 *
 * <p>This view <b>never reports a close and never nested-scrolls</b>. It is a plain {@link View}, so
 * there is nothing to opt out of; the guarantee it makes to the drawer is that
 * {@link AppDrawerContentView}'s close path is unreachable from a column stream.
 *
 * <p><b>Legibility over glass.</b> The letters sit over the plane's blur/frost with the wallpaper
 * behind it, so they are drawn the way the dock's own {@code AzScrubRowView} draws them: a crisp
 * dark stroke pass under a light fill pass. Nothing here shares that view's wave, shimmer or
 * settle animators — the rope replaces all three.
 *
 * <p><b>The lean can carry the head past the plane's right edge</b> while the column is still fading
 * in. That is the entry, not a bug: the rest line is the strip's centre 15dp from the edge and the
 * anchor starts 26dp outward, so the letters come from off the panel. It is also why
 * {@link AppDrawerRopeMetrics#COLUMN_ALPHA_END} (0.60) is well before the anchor is home (0.86) —
 * by the time the column is fully opaque the head is back inside the strip, and the whole settle
 * happens in full view.
