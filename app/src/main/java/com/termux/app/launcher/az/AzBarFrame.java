/**
 * The edge the alphabets bar stands on, as arithmetic: one affine map between the screen and the
 * <em>canonical frame</em> the whole A–Z gesture is written in.
 *
 * <p>The canonical frame is the bar the gesture was built for: a horizontal row along the bottom
 * with the icon track above it. "Along" the bar is canonical x, growing the way the letters read;
 * "away" from the bar is canonical −y, so the icon track sits at a smaller y than the letters do,
 * exactly as it does for a bottom bar. Every positional decision in {@link AzScrubGesture} — the
 * upward lock, the capture wedge, the return band — is therefore written once and holds on all four
 * edges.
 *
 * <p>The matches themselves are not in this frame: {@link AzFloatingStripPolicy} lays them out on
 * the screen as one row of icons growing away from the bar, because "reads left to right" is a
 * property of the screen and not of the bar. What the frame still decides for them is the direction
 * they rise from ({@link #awayDirectionX}/{@link #awayDirectionY}) and which side of the band the
 * focused app's name reads on.
 *
 * <p>What each edge does to the screen:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Bottom</b> is the canonical frame; the map is the identity.
 *   <li><b>Top</b> mirrors y, so "away from the bar" becomes down the screen and the letters still
 *       read left to right.
 *   <li><b>Left</b> and <b>right</b> turn the screen on its side: canonical x is screen y, so the
 *       letters read down the column, and "away from the bar" points into the content — right of a
 *       left bar, left of a right bar. Paging, which is canonical left/right, therefore becomes up
 *       and down on screen.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure: no {@code View}, no {@code Context}, no {@code RectF}. Rectangles travel as
 * {@link AzScrubGesture.Bounds}, the same immutable rectangle the gesture already speaks.
