/**
 * Bounded ownership of raw launcher artwork — the picture an app ships, before the dock's glass
 * treatment is applied to it.
 *
 * <p>Every catalogue entry used to carry its own {@link Drawable} for the life of the process. That
 * is one icon per installed app and nothing ever gave one back: 115 apps held 36.4 MB here, and the
 * cost is linear in how many apps someone has, so a 300-app device pays around 90 MB for artwork
 * that is almost entirely off screen. The model objects now carry identity, and the pixels live
 * here under a budget.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two things make a budget small enough to work. Artwork is rasterised down to
 * {@link #MAX_RETAINED_PX} on the way in — the framework hands back the system-density
 * rasterisation, 284x284 on this display, where the drawer's grid caps its cells at 48dp and the
 * dock rail asks for 38dp, so most of those pixels could never be shown. And this sits behind
 * {@link DockIconCache}, which caches the rendered result: raw artwork is only wanted when that
 * one misses, or by the few surfaces that draw an app's own icon untreated.</p>
 *
 * <p>An entry that carries artwork of its own — a folder, a per-app icon override, a test stub —
 * keeps it and is never looked up here. Those are bespoke and there is nothing to load them from.</p>
