/**
 * Owner of the app drawer plane: its state, its motion, and every transform the transition applies
 * to the dock and the accessory bands underneath it.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately shaped like {@code TerminalCommandPaletteController} — one {@link Spring}
 * channel ticked on a {@link Choreographer} callback, one {@code applyFrame} that is the single
 * writer of every animated property, views bound lazily on first use and left {@code INVISIBLE}
 * rather than {@code GONE} so the host stays measured and {@code RealtimeBlurView} can gate its own
 * work on {@code isShown()}.
 *
 * <p><b>The transition is one number.</b> {@code p ∈ [0,1]}, 0 = dock, 1 = full drawer. Under a
 * finger {@code p} is the raw travelled fraction with no easing at all, so the plane tracks 1:1;
 * only the release is animated. Everything else — the plane rectangle, the corner radius, the glass
 * cross-fade, the dock's lift, the row fades, the accessory bands — is a pure function of {@code p}
 * evaluated in {@link #applyFrame}. Nothing else may write those properties while the drawer is
 * engaged.
 *
 * <p><b>The invisible handoff.</b> At {@code p == 0} the plane rectangle <em>is</em> the dock glass
 * rect: same bounds from {@code accessory_surface_host}, and the same corner radius and horizontal
 * inset the dock itself is laid out with, both read off the one {@link DockLayout} the activity
 * resolves through {@link Host#dockLayout()}. The first tenth of the transition is then a
 * cross-fade between two identical rectangles, which is what makes the drawer look like the dock
 * growing rather than a sheet appearing over it. Any change that lets the seed rect drift from the
 * dock rect breaks that, visibly.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing is measured per frame.</b> While the drawer is engaged the accessory stack's layout
 * is frozen ({@code setTerminalToolbarHeight} and {@code applyAccessoryGeometryIfNeeded} early-return
 * and set a pending flag), because that path runs the flush-padding solver and a terminal resize —
 * a SIGWINCH per frame. The band rectangles and the dock↔keyboard gap are captured once, at drag
 * begin, and fed back to {@link AppDrawerAccessoryChoreography} unchanged on every frame;
 * re-measuring them is what reopens the accessory feedback loop. The freeze is replayed on close,
 * from a {@code finally}, so a throw can never leave the dock deaf to style changes.
 *
 * <h2>Public API</h2>
 *
 * <p>Step 6 ({@code SuggestionBarView} arbitration) drives the opening drag through:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #beginDrag(float, AppDrawerGestureArbiter.Pull, AppDrawerPullGeometry.Seed)} — the
 *       row's arbiter latched {@code DRAWER_DRAG}; pass the {@code ACTION_DOWN} point projected
 *       onto the pull's axis, the pull itself and the rectangle the plane grows out of. Captures
 *       geometry and takes ownership of the stack.
 *   <li>{@link #updateDrag(float)} — every {@code ACTION_MOVE}, the same projected coordinate.
 *   <li>{@link #endDrag(float)} — {@code ACTION_UP}, with the release velocity in px/s, positive
 *       along the pull. Applies {@link AppDrawerCommitPolicy} and springs to the outcome.
 *   <li>{@link #cancelDrag()} — {@code ACTION_CANCEL}: springs back to where the drag started.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>and reads state through {@link #isOpen()} / {@link #isEngaged()}. {@link #close(boolean)}
 * (back press, palette summon) and {@link #closeImmediate()} (lifecycle, HOME) put it away.
 * {@link #setDockChoreographyTarget} registers the dock's own choreography sink — Step 6 implements
 * {@link AppDrawerDockChoreographyTarget#setDrawerTransitionProgress(float)} on
 * {@code SuggestionBarView} to stagger the pinned icons out; until then the controller no-ops
 * safely with no target set.

     * a {@code RecyclerView}'s first layout and first bind of sixteen cells, measured at 95ms of

     * tree, at the same geometry, in a frame nobody is waiting on.
     *
     * <p>Invisible by construction: {@code app_drawer_host} stays {@code INVISIBLE} and the plane's
     * content host stays at alpha 0, so the tree is measured and laid out (only {@code GONE} would
     * skip that) while nothing of it is drawn, takes a touch or reaches accessibility. The glass
     * material, the backdrop blur and the wallpaper frost are {@link #prepareOverlay}'s and are not
     * touched here.
     *
     * <p>Runs at most once. A drawer that has already been pulled — the plane exists — is left
     * alone, and so is one that is disabled, one whose host has not laid out, and one whose
     * catalogue has not loaded: binding an empty grid would warm the wrong layout. The last two
