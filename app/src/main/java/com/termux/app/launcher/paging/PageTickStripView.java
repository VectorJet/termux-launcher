/**
 * The page indicator a pinned-apps row carries off the dock: a short strip of ticks that rides with
 * the row, lying down under it on the top edge and standing beside it on a rail.
 *
 * <p>On the dock itself the ticks are drawn by {@code LauncherAzGestureFxView}, which paints them
 * over the dock's glass while a gesture owns the row. Off the dock there is no such layer — which
 * is why a top row paged by swipe and showed nothing at all — so the strip is a band of the row's
 * own host instead, and it is drawn whenever there is more than one page rather than only under a
 * finger: a rail's pages are otherwise invisible.
 *
 * <p>The shape and the sizes are {@link PageTickStrip}'s, so the indicator is the same object on
 * every edge; only the axis changes, and it is taken from the strip's own proportions.
