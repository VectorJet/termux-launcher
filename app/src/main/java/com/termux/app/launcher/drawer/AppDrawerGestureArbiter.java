/**
 * The one-way claim machine behind the app drawer's pull-down gesture.
 *
 * <p>Pure: no {@code View}, no {@code Context}, no touch objects. The dock's touch pipeline
 * ({@code SuggestionBarView.dispatchTouchEvent}) feeds it the down point captured at
 * {@code ACTION_DOWN}, the current move point, the platform touch slop and an
 * {@link Eligibility} snapshot; it answers which gesture owns the stream.
 *
 * <p>Two properties matter more than the thresholds themselves:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The drawer test runs first.</b> The dock's horizontal page swipe used to be recomputed
 *       on every move; a vertical pull that drifted sideways could flip ownership mid-gesture.
 *   <li><b>The latch is one-way.</b> Once a claim leaves {@link Claim#PENDING} it is never
 *       re-evaluated until {@link #begin} starts a new gesture. Re-evaluation is what lets a
 *       single drag fire both the page swipe and the drawer.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The dominance ratios are deliberately asymmetric — 1.2 for the drawer against 1.1 for the
 * page — which leaves a neutral cone around the diagonal where neither test passes and the
 * gesture simply stays {@link Claim#PENDING}. Backwards drags can never satisfy the drawer test
 * (it requires travel along {@link Pull}'s own direction), so the badged-icon swipe-up is
 * untouched by construction.
