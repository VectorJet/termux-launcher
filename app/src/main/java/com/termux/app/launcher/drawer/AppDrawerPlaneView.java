/**
 * The app drawer's plane: one full-bleed view that paints a glass slab over an animated rounded
 * rectangle and owns the gesture that puts it away again.
 *
 * <p>Structurally the twin of {@code CommandPaletteView}: the view fills its host and never moves,
 * lays nothing out per frame, and expresses the whole transition as a rectangle it draws into plus
 * a {@link ViewOutlineProvider} that clips to the same rectangle. {@link #setFrame} is therefore
 * the only per-frame call, and it does no allocation.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the slab is drawn rather than laid out.</b> A child view sized to the frame would need
 * a measure/layout pass per frame, on a view tree whose accessory stack is deliberately frozen for
 * exactly that reason. Drawing a {@link Drawable} into the frame costs one {@code setBounds} and
 * one {@code draw}, and the outline clip trims the overdrawn edge.
 *
 * <p><b>Closing drag.</b> A downward drag anywhere on the plane runs the transition backwards. It
 * reuses {@link AppDrawerGestureArbiter} — the same one-way latch the dock uses to open — rather
 * than a second ad-hoc state machine, so "downward, dominated by its vertical component, past
 * 1.15x slop" means one thing in this app and not two. The plane reports raw screen-Y to
 * {@link Callbacks}; the controller owns every decision about what that Y means.
