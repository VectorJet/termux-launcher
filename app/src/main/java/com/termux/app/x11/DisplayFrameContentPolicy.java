/**
 * What the keyboard frame holds on the Display place while mouse mode owns it: the touchpad, or
 * the keyboard standing in front of a parked pad.
 *
 * <p>Mouse mode gives the pad the keyboard's frame, so for as long as it is on there is only one
 * frame and two things that want it. Rather than take the frame away and put it back — which
 * resizes the X screen twice and loses the pointer — the frame keeps its size and swaps its
 * content: {@link Content#PAD} while the user is pointing, {@link Content#KEYBOARD} while they
 * are typing into whatever took text focus. Turning mouse mode off is the only thing that hands
 * the frame back to the keyboard alone ({@link Content#NONE}) — and if the pad had to raise that
 * frame itself, because no keyboard was up when mouse mode came on, the frame goes away with the
 * pad ({@link Decision#releaseFrame}): the mouse key then opens and closes the pad, and nothing
 * else, which is what a toggle is. A keyboard the user asked for in the meantime is theirs, and
 * stays.
 *
 * <p>All policy, no views: every event answers with a {@link Decision} the caller applies. Three
 * things ask for the swap and they mean different things to the text-focus policy beside this one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The mouse key.</b> With the keyboard parked in front of the pad it brings the pad
 *       back, still in mouse mode; with the pad up it leaves mouse mode, as it always has.
 *   <li><b>The keyboard key</b>, and {@code keyboard.show}/{@code keyboard.hide} with a manual
 *       source. The user asking for the keyboard is the user asking, so it {@link Intent#PIN
 *       pins} the text-focus policy off; asking for it down hands it back.
 *   <li><b>A text field taking or losing focus</b>, through the text-focus policy itself. It has
 *       already moved its own state, so these carry {@link Intent#NONE}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A {@link Decision} that was not {@link Decision#taken} means mouse mode does not own the
 * frame: the caller does the plain thing it does everywhere else — show the keyboard, hide it,
 * toggle it — and this class has changed nothing.
