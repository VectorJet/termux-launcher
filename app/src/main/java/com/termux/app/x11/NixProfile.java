/**
 * The nix edition's package tree, read from Android's side of the fence.
 *
 * <p>That edition has no Termux prefix: {@code $PREFIX/bin} holds a handful of bootstrap
 * commands and nothing else, and everything a user installs lives in the nix store at
 * {@code $PREFIX/nix/store}. What is installed right now is the profile
 * {@code $PREFIX/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/nix-on-droid/profile}, and every session runs
 * inside a proot that binds {@code $PREFIX/nix} onto {@code /nix}. So a store path written down
 * anywhere inside that world — and they all are, since nix hardcodes them — reads
 * {@code /nix/store/…}, which is nothing at all from outside the proot.
 *
 * <p>Two things follow, and this class is both of them:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Rewriting.</b> {@link #rewrite} turns a path written inside the proot into the Android
 *       path that holds the same bytes, using the same bind list the login script passes to
 *       proot. Nothing else in the launcher knows that list.
 *   <li><b>Walking.</b> A profile is a tree of symlinks, and each of them can be relative
 *       ({@code profile -> profile-2-link}) or an absolute {@code /nix/…} that the Android side
 *       cannot follow at all. Java's own {@code getCanonicalPath} gives up on the first of those,
 *       so {@link #resolve} follows the chain a hop at a time, rewriting as it goes, and
 *       {@link #under} does that for every component of a path — because in a merged profile any
 *       component can be the one that turns into a store link.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure file reading and string work, so all of it is tested against fixture trees. Nothing
 * here starts a process, and on an edition that is not nix every entry point answers "no" from
 * one {@code lstat}.
