/**
 * The one command the "Get GUI apps" screen hands the user. Two routes to a graphical app on this
 * phone, and the shell line that takes each of them.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here runs anything and nothing here touches Android: a route, a distro and a handful
 * of ticked apps go in, one string comes out, and every branch of it is read back by a test. The
 * screen copies that string to the clipboard and the user pastes it into the terminal — which is
 * the whole point of the flow, because everything the command does (fetching a few hundred
 * megabytes, asking for a password) is better watched in a terminal than hidden behind a
 * progress bar.
 *
 * <h3>The two routes</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Termux's X11 apps.</b> One extra repository and the apps themselves, built for this
 *       phone. Small and quick, and the apps are the ones Termux packages.
 *   <li><b>A full Linux inside.</b> A whole distro under {@code proot-distro}, with the distro's
 *       own package manager and its own far larger catalogue. Slower to set up and it asks for an
 *       account name and a password, because a desktop app expects to be an ordinary user.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Package names</h3>
 *
 * Checked against the live indexes on 2026-09-20: Termux's {@code x11} repository for route one,
 * Debian trixie, Ubuntu noble and Arch's own package search for route two. VAJ's own apt
 * repository (repo.pathayam.xyz) was checked separately on 2026-09-21 and uses the same package
 * names as Termux's {@code x11} repository, minus a browser, which it does not carry. A name
 * that is wrong is a command that stops halfway with the user watching, so they are written down
 * here rather than guessed at per distro.
