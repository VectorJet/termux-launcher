 * socket handed to the view, its logcat pipe, and the fact of whether it is running at all.
 *
 * <p>The server is a separate process on purpose — it is what power users expect from
 * {@code termux-x11}, and it keeps an X server crash away from the home screen. Nothing here
 * starts one: a display exists because someone typed {@code termux-x11 :0}, or because the user
 * turned on the opt-in that runs that command at start-up.
 *
 * <p>One controller exists per activity and is {@link #destroy() destroyed} with it. The server
 * outlives both; its announcement is handed across through {@link X11DisplayReceiver}, so the
 * next activity's controller starts with the Binder rather than waiting for the server to knock.
