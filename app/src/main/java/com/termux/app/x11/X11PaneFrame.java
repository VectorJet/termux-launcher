/**
 * The wall's Display page: the embedded X server's surface, wearing a terminal pane's rim, radius
 * and gap.
 *
 * <p>It carries the same glass slab the panes and the Widgets page do, taken from the same
 * {@link PaneSurfaceStyle}, so the Display place follows the Canvas surface with the rest of the
 * wall. The slab sits behind the display: a {@code SurfaceView} punches its own rect out of the
 * window while its surface is on screen, so the glass reads through the empty state and in the
 * band the corners leave, and a running display covers it.
 *
 * <p>The rounded corners are painted rather than clipped: a {@code SurfaceView}'s surface is
 * composited outside the view hierarchy, so no parent outline reaches it, and there is no public
 * {@code SurfaceView} corner radius at compileSdk 36 (checked, not assumed). The mask paints what
 * sits behind the page over the four arcs instead — which is also what rounds the slab, since
 * this frame cannot clip — and the surface fills the frame flush to its rim so a maximised X
 * window meets the same corners the panes have.
 *
 * <p>While no server is running the page shows its empty state, which is where a home screen
 * rests: the launcher never starts a display on its own. A hold on one of the page's four corners
 * drops the same tab a pane's corner does, out of the corner that was held: power, the
 * display's settings, and the Appearance and Layout doors every place carries — and, while a
 * display runs, the scale rail along the page's leading
 * edge, which is out only while that tab is. Between the corners the edges are X's: a maximised
 * window is touchable to its rim.
