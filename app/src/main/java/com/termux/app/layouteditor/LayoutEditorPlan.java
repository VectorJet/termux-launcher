/**
 * One Layout editor session, as decisions rather than views: which orientation the miniature is
 * showing, which one a drop writes, whether the live place behind the editor follows it, whether
 * anything has moved since the editor opened, and how to put it all back.
 *
 * <p>The miniature draws either orientation whatever the phone is in, so "shown" and "the phone's"
 * are two different questions. A drop always writes the shown one — that is the orientation the
 * user is looking at a picture of — and the place behind the editor can only follow while the two
 * agree. Editing the other orientation therefore changes the miniature and nothing else until the
 * phone is turned.
 *
 * <p>The rows beneath the miniature are the same question asked of the same store: what this place
 * offers that no bar can be dragged into — how its keyboard stands, whether it opens on entry, how
 * many cells its grid has, and how tall its dock and its keyboard stand. They come from
 * {@link PlaceArrangeModel}, which already answers for one orientation at a time, so the toggle
 * moves the rows exactly as it moves the picture.
 *
 * <p>Pure: a store in, an answer out, no views, so every case above is testable without a window.
 * {@link LayoutEditorController} is the shell that draws it.
