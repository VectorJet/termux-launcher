 * Pure one-way status gesture arbitration over one immutable DOWN snapshot.
 *
 * <p>Two gestures share the bar and they are always perpendicular: one drags the pane wall along
 * the bar's own length, the other folds and unfolds the bar across it. Which screen axis each of
 * those is follows the edge the bar stands on — a bar along the top or the bottom pages sideways
 * and folds vertically; a bar down the left or the right pages up and down and folds sideways.
 * Everything below is written in those two axes, so the arbitration is one rule rather than four.
