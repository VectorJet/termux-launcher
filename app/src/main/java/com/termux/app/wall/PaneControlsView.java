/**
 * The tab a wall page drops from the corner that was tapped: the same fill, stroke and motion a
 * terminal pane's tab has, so every place on the wall answers a corner tap the same way. It slides
 * out of whichever edge that corner is on — down from a top corner, up from a bottom one — and
 * lines up with whichever side it is on.
 *
 * <p>What the tab holds is the page's own business — the Display page offers power and its
 * settings, the Widgets page offers its settings and an edit pencil, and while a widget is being
 * edited the same corner reads out the grid's size — so the buttons are handed in as
 * {@link Action}s and this view knows only how to lay them out, draw them and say which one a
 * finger landed on. The page keeps the touches: the view is never clickable, so it cannot stand
 * between a finger and whatever the page is drawing underneath.
 *
 * <p>A button is a 30dp square with a Nerd Font glyph or a mark drawn by hand, or a strip as wide
 * as its own text. Both are roomier than a pane's tab on purpose — these sit over a live picture
 * with no other chrome to steady the thumb, and the 22dp pair was missed as often as hit.
 *
 * <p>The frame the tab hangs off is the view's own bounds by default, which is what a page wants:
 * the view is laid over the page and the tab lands on the page's own corner. A terminal pane is
 * not a view of its own — one overlay draws the tabs of every pane on the wall — so that caller
 * hands in a {@link FrameSource} instead, and the tab is laid out and drawn inside whichever pane
 * it names, in the overlay's own coordinates.
