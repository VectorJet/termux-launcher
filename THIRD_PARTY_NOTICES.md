# Open-source licenses and attributions

Termux Launcher is a modified distribution of
[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) and
[Termux:Monet](https://github.com/Termux-Monet/termux-monet). The launcher-specific source is
available at [PickleHik3/termux-launcher](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher).

The project as a whole is distributed under GPLv3-only. Full license texts are included with the
source distribution and in the app's **Settings > Open-source licenses** screen.

- **[Unexpected-Keyboard](https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard)** — GPL-3.0 — Copyright Jules Aguillon (Julow) and Unexpected-Keyboard contributors. Vendored and modified as the `inapp-keyboard/` module (upstream commit `38836e440d8ca779d572b52601c6b2ad10f3bb7f` recorded in `inapp-keyboard/UPSTREAM.md`); modifications include removal of the IME service and adaptation as an embedded view. See `inapp-keyboard/UPSTREAM.md`.
- **Terminal Emulator for Android** — Apache-2.0 — Copyright Jack Palevich and contributors.
- **Android Open Source Project / Launcher3** — Apache-2.0 — portions of terminal compatibility,
  `termux-am-library`, and launcher gesture navigation.
- **Lawnchair** — Apache-2.0 — launcher gesture-navigation compatibility adapted from Lawnchair.
- **RealtimeBlurView** — Apache-2.0 — Copyright 2016 Tu Yimin. The vendored implementation is
  modified by Termux Launcher.
- **libsuperuser** — Apache-2.0 — Copyright 2012–2019 Jorrit "Chainfire" Jongma.
- **libcore/ojluni** — GPLv2-only with the Classpath exception — filesystem compatibility classes.
- **MNN 3.6.0** — Apache-2.0 — Copyright 2018 Alibaba Group. Termux Launcher distributes modified
  arm64 native builds and a patched UTF-8 stream processor.
- **nlohmann/json 3.11.2** — MIT — Copyright 2013–2022 Niels Lohmann. It is statically included in
  the MNN Android JNI library.
- **Tinted Theming schemes** — MIT — imported on demand from
  [tinted-theming/schemes](https://github.com/tinted-theming/schemes); palette authors remain
  credited in the downloaded scheme metadata.
- **[noctalia shell](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell)** — MIT — Copyright the
  noctalia-shell contributors. The `starship` and `helix` theme templates under
  `app/src/main/assets/theme-templates/` are ported from noctalia's
  `assets/templates/{starship,helix}/`, renamed from `noctalia` to `launcher-material` and
  adapted to the launcher's own hook environment and Material palette (no filters or wallpaper
  ANSI-derivation logic carried over).
- **[termux-x11](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11)** — GPL-3.0-only — Copyright Twaik Yont
  and termux-x11 contributors. The `lorie` library module is vendored and modified as
  `x11-server/` and its `shell-loader` as `x11-server/loader/` (upstream commit
  `9df8b767645aa0d0a2f2576767449df55b41962f`, recorded in `x11-server/UPSTREAM.md` with every
  deviation); the `libXlorie.so` prebuilts under `app/src/main/jniLibs/` are built from the same
  commit with the one patch in `ci/x11-patch/`. `libXlorie.so` statically links the freedesktop
  components termux-x11 builds from source: the **X.Org Server**, **libX11**, **xorgproto**,
  **libXfont2**, **libxkbfile**, **xkbcomp**, **libxcvt**, **libxshmfence**, **xtrans**,
  **libXau**, **libXdmcp** and **libfontenc** (MIT/X11 licenses, see the notice below),
  **pixman** (MIT), **libepoxy** (MIT), **libtirpc** (BSD-3-Clause — Copyright Sun Microsystems,
  Inc.) and **bzip2** (bzip2 license — Copyright 1996–2019 Julian Seward).

## Bundled assets

- **[Symbols Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)** — SIL Open Font License 1.1
  — Copyright 2014 Ryan L McIntyre and Nerd Fonts contributors. Shipped as
  `app/src/main/assets/fonts/SymbolsNerdFontMono.ttf`, drawn on app chrome and extracted for the
  terminal font config. The icon sets Nerd Fonts aggregates — Material Design Icons, Font Awesome,
  Octicons, Weather Icons, Devicons, Codicons, Powerline and others — remain under their own
  licenses; see the Nerd Fonts license audit. The glyph names in
  `app/src/main/res/raw/nerd_font_glyphs.csv` are generated from that font's own name table.
- **[Meteocons](https://github.com/basmilius/meteocons)** — MIT — Copyright 2020-present Bas
  Milius. The weather animations in `app/src/main/assets/weather/` are the fill style of
  `@meteocons/lottie`, unmodified apart from compact re-serialization; the license text ships beside
  them as `app/src/main/assets/weather/LICENSE.txt`.

## Runtime libraries

The Android application also uses these independently maintained libraries:

- AndroidX and Material Components for Android — Apache-2.0
- Android Image Cropper — Apache-2.0
- Apache Commons IO — Apache-2.0
- Google Guava — Apache-2.0
- Google LiteRT and LiteRT-LM — Apache-2.0
- Lottie for Android — Apache-2.0 — renders the bundled Meteocons weather animations
- HiddenApiBypass — Apache-2.0
- Markwon — Apache-2.0
- Process Phoenix — Apache-2.0
- SentencePiece4J — Apache-2.0
- Shizuku API — Apache-2.0
- CommonMark Java — BSD-2-Clause

Dependencies used only by tests and build tooling are not part of the distributed APK. Their
licenses remain available in their respective distributions.

## Build recipes for external terminal tools

The `recipes/` directory builds third-party command-line tools that exercise the launcher's
graphics protocols. **No binary of any of these is distributed inside the Termux Launcher APK.**
This repository contains only build scripts and patches; the tools are compiled from upstream
sources on the machine that runs a recipe.

Prebuilt `aarch64` binaries of three of them — `kitten`, the patched Fastfetch, and Sigye — are
published separately at
[PickleHik3/termux-launcher-binaries](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher-binaries),
which `tlstore`'s catalog can install. That repository carries the upstream licence texts, the
patches, the build recipes, and the corresponding-source pointers for the GPL-3.0-only `kitten`.
The notices below apply to those builds.

- **[Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)** — MIT — Copyright 2021–2023 Linus
  Dierheimer, 2022– Carter Li. Built from pinned commit `9c7cfb8` (v2.67.0) with the repository's
  animated Kitty graphics patch.
- **[Sigye](https://github.com/am2rican5/sigye)** — MIT — built from pinned commit `0f0b8ca`
  (v0.6.0) with the repository's Termux clipboard patch.
- **[kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) `kitten`** — GPL-3.0-only — Copyright Kovid Goyal.
  Built from tag `v0.48.2`. The binary statically links kitty's Go dependencies (MIT and
  BSD-licensed), whose notices travel with it. Distributing a built `kitten` obliges the
  distributor to offer the corresponding source under GPLv3.
- **[Chafa](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa)** — LGPL-3.0-or-later — Copyright Hans Petter
  Jansson. Fastfetch loads `libchafa.so` with `dlopen` at run time and does not link it statically,
  which is also what keeps LGPLv3's relinking requirement out of scope. Chafa itself bundles
  lodepng (Zlib) and libnsgif (MIT).
- **[ImageMagick 7](https://imagemagick.org/)** — SPDX `ImageMagick` (the ImageMagick License, an
  Apache-2.0 derivative, not Apache-2.0 itself) — Copyright ImageMagick Studio LLC. Also loaded
  with `dlopen` at run time.

Chafa and ImageMagick reach a device through the Termux package repositories, not through this
project.

## Data sources

- **[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)** — forecast data licensed
  [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The status bar's weather reading and
  its detail card are drawn from Open-Meteo's keyless forecast API, and carry the credit
  **Weather data by Open-Meteo.com** beside the data. No account, API key or personal identifier is
  sent — a request carries the device's last known coordinates to four decimal places and nothing
  else — and a request is only made when the weather reading is enabled and location permission has
  been granted. Open-Meteo's own server software is AGPLv3; Termux Launcher calls the public API and
  distributes none of it.
